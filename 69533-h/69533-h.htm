IT may perhaps be interesting to the readers of this
book to give a short account of its origin. From the
earliest days of my pupilage to art I had been instinctively
drawn towards the paintings of Turner, Corot,
Constable, Bonington, and Watts, with an intense
admiration for their manner in viewing, and methods of
recreating, nature upon their canvases; and in later years I had been
fascinated by the works of more modern artists, such as La Thangue,
George Clausen, Edward Stott, and Robert Meyerheim. In 1891,
a student in Paris, I found myself face to face with a beautiful
development of landscape painting, which was quite new to me.
“Impressionism,” together with its numerous progeny of eccentric
offshoots, was at the time causing a great furore in the schools.
Curiously enough I had been charged with copying Monet’s style
long before I had seen his actual work, so that my conversion into
an enthusiastic Impressionist was short, in fact, an instantaneous
process.</p>

<p class='c013'>Since then I have endeavoured, by precept and by example, to
preach the doctrine of Impressionism, particularly in England, where
it is so little known and appreciated. It has always seemed to me
astonishing that an art which has shown such magnificent proofs of
virility, which has long been accepted at its true value on the
Continent and in America, should be comparatively neglected in my
own country. A stimulating propaganda being needed, I invaded
for a short time the domain of the writer on art, a sphere of activity
for which I feel myself none too well equipped. For years, as a
hobby, I had collected all manner of documents bearing upon the
subject of Impressionism, and the mass of material which thus
accumulated formed the basis for several articles which have appeared
under my name in the English magazines. To the Editors of the <i>Pall
Mall Magazine</i>, the <i>Artist</i>, and the <i>Studio</i>, I must
tender my best thanks for the leave, so courteously given, to
incorporate the substance of the respective articles in this volume.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>Many of the pictures which illustrate these pages are unique,
having been reproduced for the first time, the photographs not being
for public sale. I have to acknowledge my sincere obligations to
Miss Mary Cassatt, Messieurs Durand-Ruel (who have given me
much personal assistance), George Petit, Bernheim jeune, Maxime
Maufra, Alexander Harrison, Paul Chevallier, Lucien Sauphar, Emile
Claus, Max Liebermann, and, indeed, to all the artists illustrated, for
permission to use the photographs of their works. To Miss Mary
Cassatt, and Messieurs Claude Monet, Emile Claus, and Max Liebermann
I am also indebted for the loan of valuable pictures, and also
for permission to reproduce them in colours. Without such aid it
would have been impossible to produce satisfactorily any account of
Impressionism. I trust that this volume may be of real service in
the cause of art education, and that it may introduce to an extended
circle of art-lovers the masterpieces of the great artists who founded
and are continuing Impressionist Painting.</p>

ALTHOUGH the great revolution of 1793 changed
the whole face of France both politically and socially,
it failed to emancipate the twin arts of painting and
literature. In each case one tradition was succeeded
by another, and nearly forty years elapsed before the
new spirit completely broke through the barriers set
up by a past generation.</p>

<p class='c021'>In literature the victory was complete. The reason is easy to
discover. The smart dramatist and the young novelist are always
more likely to catch the fickle taste of the uneducated public than
the budding painter, who depends to a great extent for his appreciation
upon the trained and generally prejudiced eye of a connoisseur.
There is another reason for the success of the Romantic School in
literature. The majority of its leaders lived to extreme old age, and
were themselves able to correct their youthful extravagances. Hugo,
Dumas, Gautier (to mention but three) went down to their graves in
honour. They had outlived the antagonisms of their early days, and
no man dared to raise his voice in protest against poets who had
added fresh laurels to the glory of France.</p>

<p class='c021'>The world of art was less fortunate. Many of the younger men
barely lived through the first flush of youth. Destroying Death is
the worst enemy to the arts. It is idle to imagine the changes
which must have ensued had Géricault and Bonington reached the
Psalmist’s allotted span. The unnatural union of Classical traditions
with the yeast of Romanticism might not have taken place. Such
artists as Delaroche and Couture would have dropped into the background,
and there would have been less reason for the revolt of
Edouard Manet. It is possible that Claude Monet might have been
forestalled. Surely, Impressionism would have come to us in another
shape from different easels. In any event it was bound to arrive, for
a French artist had already struck the note nearly a century and a
half before.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>The schools of painting which flourished under the last three
Capet kings lacked many of the essentials of truly great art. But
they possessed qualities, which the Classicalists despised, and the
Romanticists never reached in exactly the same way. They possessed
a strong sense of colour. Watteau, in particular, was the first to
catch the sunlight. The painters of “les fêtes galantes” are artificial,
unreal, dominated by mannerisms. But the cold inanities of David,
Girodet, Gérard, and Gros are no more to be compared with them
than the bituminous melodramatics of the lesser Romantic artists.</p>

<p class='c021'>Watteau’s successors never entirely lost their master’s sense of
light and colour. In a mild way Chardin attempted realism.
Boucher, and, later, Fragonard were influenced by that Japanese art
which was to take such a prominent place in the movement of a
hundred years later. But the world altered. The stern, hard ideals
of Rome and Greece were too severe for these poor triflers with the
Orient. David reigned supreme. The <i>Journal de l’Empire</i> considered
Boucher ridiculous. Unhappy, forgotten Fragonard, surely one of
the most pathetic of figures, died in poverty whilst the drums of
Austerlitz were still reverberating through the air.</p>

<p class='c021'>Ingres, a pupil of David, taught his students that draughtsmanship
was of more importance than colour. “A thing well drawn,” he
said, “is always well enough painted.” Such teaching was bound to
provoke dissent, and the germs of the coming revolution were to
cross from England. Byron and Scott were the sources of the
literary revolution which swept across Europe. British artists
showed the way in the fight against tradition and form, which
resulted in the School of Barbizon, and its great successor, the
School of Impressionism.</p>

<p class='c021'>Excluding the miniaturists, and such foreign masters as Holbein,
Vandyck, Kneller, and Lely, English art could hardly boast one
hundred consecutive years of history when its landscape artists first
exhibited in the Paris Salon. The French School could not forget
Italy and its own past. Even to this day the entrance to the École
des Beaux-Arts is guarded by two colossal busts of Poujet and
Poussin, and the supreme prize in its gift is the Prix de Rome. But
English art has never been trammelled excessively by its own past,
simply because it did not possess one, and, with insular pride, refused
to accept that of the Continent.</p>

<p class='c021'>Hogarth is a case in point. His education was slight and
desultory; he did not indulge in the Grand Tour; he professed a
truly British scorn for foreigners, uttering “blasphemous expressions
against the divinity even of Raphael, Correggio, and Michelangelo.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>He took his subjects from the life which daily surged under his
windows in Leicester Square, and when he attempted a classical
composition he utterly failed, and was promptly told so by his
numerous enemies. His canvases form historical records of the men
and women of the early Georgian era, in much the same manner as
Edouard Manet represents the “noceurs” and “cocottes” who
wrecked the Second Empire and reappeared during the first decade
of the Third Republic.</p>

<p class='c021'>Hogarth was a colourist, and the early English School was always
one of colour and animation, attempting to follow Nature as closely
as possible. Some of the slighter portrait studies of Sir Joshua
Reynolds have a strong affinity to the work of the French Impressionists.
Richard Wilson was not altogether blind to the beautiful
world around him, although he considered an English landscape
always improved by a Grecian temple. Gainsborough was decidedly
no formalist, and whilst the lifeless group, comprising Barry, West,
Fuseli, and Northcote, was endeavouring to inculcate the classical
idea, the English Water-colour School began to appear, the Norwich
School was in the distance, Turner’s wonderful career had commenced,
and Constable, the handsome boy from Suffolk, was studying atmospheric
effects and the play of sunlight from the windows of his
father’s mill at Bergholt. In 1819 Géricault, one of the leaders of
the reaction in France against Classicalism, paid a visit to England.
He does not seem to have been greatly influenced by English work,
owing no doubt to his lamentably early death. But his visit resulted
in Constable and Bonington becoming known in France.</p>

<p class='c021'>For years English painters exhibited regularly at the Salon. In
1822, the year when Delacroix hung <i>Dante’s Bark</i>, Bonington
exhibited the <i>View of Lillebonne</i> and a <i>View of Havre</i>, whilst other
Englishmen exhibiting were Copley Fielding, John Varley, and
Robson. In 1824 the Englishmen were still more prominent. John
Constable received the Gold Medal from Charles X. for the <i>Hay
Wain</i> (now in the London National Gallery), and exhibited in
company with Bonington, Copley Fielding, Harding, Samuel
Prout, and Varley. In 1827 Constable exhibited for the last time,
and, curious omen for the future, between the frames of Constable
and Bonington was hung a canvas by a young painter who had
never been accepted by the Salon before. His name was Corot, and
he was quite unknown.</p>

<p class='c021'>The influence of these Englishmen upon French painting during
the nineteenth century is one of the most striking episodes in the
history of art. They were animated by a new spirit, the spirit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>of sincerity and truth. The French landscape group of 1830,
which embraced such giants as Corot, Rousseau, and Daubigny, was
the direct result of Constable’s power. The path was made ready
for Manet, who, though not a “paysagiste,” became the head of the
group which included Monet, Sisley, and Pissarro. Forty years later
the younger men sought fresh inspiration in the works of an
Englishman. Indirectly, Impressionism owes its birth to Constable;
and its ultimate glory, the works of Claude Monet, is profoundly
inspired by the genius of Turner.</p>

<p class='c021'>When the principles which animated these epoch-making
English artists are contrasted with those which ruled the Impressionists,
their resemblance is found to be strong. “There is room
enough for a natural painter,” wrote Constable to a friend after
visiting an exhibition which had bored him. “Come and see
sincere works,” wrote Manet in his catalogue. “Tone is the most
seductive and inviting quality a picture can possess,” said Constable.
It cannot be too clearly understood that the Impressionistic idea
is of English birth. Originated by Constable, Turner, Bonington,
and some members of the Norwich School, like most innovators
they found their practice to be in advance of the age. British artists
did not fully grasp the significance of their work, and failed to profit
by their valuable discoveries.</p>

<p class='c021'>It was not the first brilliant idea which, evolved in England, has
had to cross the Channel for due appreciation, for appreciated it
certainly was not in the country of its origin. As the genius of the
dying Turner flickered out, English art reached its deepest degradation.
The official art of the Great Exhibition of 1851 has become
a byword and a reproach. In English minds it stands for everything
that is insincere, unreal, tawdry, and trivial.</p>

<p class='c021'>The group of pre-Raphaelites, brilliantly gifted as they
undoubtedly were, worked upon a foundation of retrograde
mediævalism. And, as the years followed each other, English art
failed as a whole to recover its lost vitality. Domestic anecdote,
according to the formulæ of Augustus Egg, Poole, or, slightly higher
in the scale, Mulready and Maclise, formed the product of nearly
every studio. The false Greco-Roman convention of Lord Leighton
luckily had no following. Rejuvenescence came from France in the
shape of Impressionism, and English art received back an idea she
had, as it proved, but lent.</p>

<p class='c021'>Those Englishmen who are taunted with following the methods
of the French Impressionists, sneered at for imitating a foreign style,
are in reality but practising their own, for the French artists simply
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>developed a style which was British in its conception. Many things
had assisted this development, some accidental, some natural. All
the Englishmen had worked to a large extent in the open. Now
the atmosphere of France lends itself admirably to Impressionistic
painting “en plein air.” All landscapists notice that the light is
purer, stronger, and less variable in France than in England.</p>

<p class='c021'>By thus working in the open both Constable and Turner, together
with their French followers, were able to realise upon canvas a
closer verisimilitude to the varying moods of nature than had been
attempted before. By avoiding artificially darkened studios they
were able to study the problems of light with an actuality impossible
under a glass roof. They were in fact children of the sun, and
through its worship they evolved an entirely new school of picture-making.
The Modern Impressionist, too, is a worshipper of light, and
is never happier than when attempting to fix upon his canvas some
beautiful effect of sunshine, some exquisite gradation of atmosphere.
Who better than Turner can teach the use and practice of value and
tone? In triumph he fixed those fleeting mists upon his immortal
canvases, immortal unhappily only so long as bitumen, mummy, and
other pigment abominations will allow.</p>

<p class='c021'>The technical methods of the French Impressionists and of the
early English group vary but little. The modern method of placing
side by side upon the canvas spots, streaks, or dabs of more or less
pure colour, following certain defined scientific principles, was made
habitual use of by Turner. Both Constable and Turner worked
pure white in impasto throughout their canvases, high light and
shadow equally, long before the advent of the Frenchmen.</p>

<p class='c021'>An example of this was to be seen in a large painting by Constable
hung in the Royal Academy Winter Exhibition of 1903. <i>The
Opening of Waterloo Bridge</i>, exhibited in 1832, was declared by the
artist’s enemies to have been painted with his palette-knife. Almost
the whole of the canvas, especially the foreground, is dragged over
by a full charged brush of pure white, which, catching the uneven
surface of the underlying dry impasto work, produces a simple but
successful illusion of brilliant vibrating light.</p>

<p class='c021'>This work was not well received by the contemporary press and
public. It was regarded as a bad joke, became celebrated as a snowstorm,
compared with Berlin wool-work (a favourite simile which
Mr. Henley has recently applied to Burne-Jones), and was derided
as the product of a disordered brain. Seventy years have barely
sufficed for its full appreciation.</p>

<p class='c021'>By a curious coincidence Bonington’s <i>Boulogne Fishmarket</i> was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>hung almost exactly opposite in the same Winter Exhibition. This
canvas must have had an enormous influence with Manet, its blond
harmony and rich flat values within a distinct general tone being a
distinguishing feature of the great Frenchman’s style.</p>

<p class='c021'>The Impressionists, therefore, continued the methods of the
English masters. But they added a strange and exotic ingredient.
To the art of Corot and Constable they added the art of Japan, an
art which had profoundly influenced French design one hundred
years before. The opening of the Treaty ports flooded Europe with
craft work from the islands. From Japanese colour-prints, and the
gossamer sketches on silk and rice-paper, the Impressionists learnt
the manner of painting scenes as observed from an altitude, with
the curious perspective which results. They awoke to the multiplied
gradation of values and to the use of pure colour in flat masses.
This art was the source of the evolution to a system of simpler
lines.</p>

<p class='c021'>In colour they ultimately departed from the practice of the
English and Barbizon Schools. The Impressionists purified the
palette, discarding blacks, browns, ochres, and muddy colours generally,
together with all bitumens and siccatives. These they replaced by
new and brilliant combinations, the result of modern chemical
research. Cadmium Pale, Violet de Cobalt, Garance rose doré,
enabled them to attain a higher degree of luminosity than was
before possible. Special care was given to the study and rendering
of colour, and also to the reflections to be found in shadows.</p>

<p class='c021'>So far as the term implies the position of teacher and pupils, the
Impressionists did not form themselves into a school. On the
contrary, they were independent co-workers, banded together by
friendship, moved by the same sentiments, each one striving to solve
the same æsthetic problem. At the same time it is possible to
separate them into distinct personalities and groups.</p>

<p class='c021'>Edouard Manet occupies a position alone. His work can be
separated into two periods, divided by the year 1870. His earlier
work deeply influenced Claude Monet, who was a prominent
member of the group which gathered round Manet at the Café
Guerbois. After 1870 the position was slightly changed, for,
although he retained the nominal leadership of the group which was
now known under the title of Impressionists, Manet was influenced
by the technique of Claude Monet. The question has yet to be
decided whether Manet or Monet was the founder of the new
school. Monsieur Camille Mauclair declares for the latter, stating
that Manet’s pre-eminence was due to the attention he attracted by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>his excessive realism, and that Claude Monet was the true initiator.
It may be admitted that Impressionism, as the phrase is now
understood, did not really gather force until 1867. Claude Monet
was greatly attracted by Manet’s work as early as 1863, and upon
these new methods he seems to have based his own, widened though
after his visit to London with Pissarro in 1870.</p>

<p class='c021'>During his lifetime Manet was the recognised head, and around
him was formed the famous circle of the Café Guerbois, which
became known as the School of Batignolles. This included Monet,
Pissarro, Sisley, Cézanne, Renoir, and Degas. If there is one man
greater than the others it is Claude Monet. Only during comparatively
recent years have his originality and strength been
generally recognised. He now occupies the position held by
Manet, although he cannot be said to be Manet’s successor. Manet
painted the figure, seldom attempting landscape, a <i>genre</i> which is
primarily Monet’s. Claude Monet is doubly indebted to English
art. Profoundly moved by Turner, whose works he studied at first
hand in England, he also traces an artistic descent through Jongkind
and Boudin from Corot, who caught the methods of Constable and
Bonington.</p>

<p class='c021'>Jongkind and Boudin are two little masters not to be forgotten.
Not altogether Impressionists themselves, they were in close affinity
to the school upon which they had much influence. Men of
uncommon character and earnestness of purpose, their art was sincere.
In themselves they were interesting, for, richly endowed with
natural talents, they were for the most part poor beyond belief in
material wealth. Inspired by a genuine love for Nature in all her
aspects they never reached the high technique of their English
predecessors, and were far surpassed by Claude Monet and his group.
Forerunners in the evolution of the school of “plein air” painting,
a reference is necessary to them in order to follow the development
of the school as a whole.</p>

<p class='c021'>For the first time in the history of art women have taken an
active part in founding a new school. Madame Berthe Morisot,
Miss Mary Cassatt, and Madame Eva Gonzalès must be included
amongst the early Impressionists.</p>

<p class='c021'>Various movements based upon the Impressionistic idea have
taken place in France and on the Continent generally. There are
the <i>Pointillistes</i> for instance, and the Neo-Impressionists. Amongst
foreign artists Whistler must be mentioned; a student at Gleyre’s
he attended at the Café Guerbois, and embraced many of Manet’s
ideas.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>The history of the early battles over Impressionism centres for
the most part round one personality. In following the story of the
failures and successes of Edouard Manet we follow the gradual rise
of the entire school, for no man fought more bravely in defence of
its principles.</p>

JONGKIND and Boudin are the links which connect
the Barbizon men of 1830 to the Impressionist
group of 1870. Although little public fame came
to them during their lifetime, they had considerable
influence upon the younger landscape-painters of
their generation. Both were artists of great ability
as well as of enormous industry; both suffered from continued misfortune
and neglect. Yet no collection illustrating the history of
Impressionism can exclude examples of the Dutch Jongkind, or of
Boudin, a follower of Corot and master of Monet. Jongkind’s
pictures are doubling, nay trebling, in value, and the records of
the public sale-rooms are astounding evidences of the increasing
appreciation of Boudin by modern collectors.</p>

<p class='c021'>The biographies of Jongkind and Boudin form excellent texts over
which one may moralise upon the uncertainties of art as a career.
It is not often that the Fates compel two men to struggle for so
long against such hopeless and wretched surroundings. The life of
Jongkind was a life of continued misery. Towards its end he utterly
gave way, and died a dipsomaniac. Boudin possessed a little more
grit, although his surroundings were not more propitious. He
lived almost unnoticed until a beneficent Minister awarded him the
greatest prize a Frenchman can receive on this earth, the Cross of the
Legion of Honour.</p>

<p class='c021'>Johann Barthold Jongkind was born at Lathrop, near Rotterdam,
in 1819. Dutch by birth, many years’ residence in France, together
with a strong sympathy with Gallic ways, made him almost a citizen
of his adopted country, and certainly a member of the French School
of Painting. At first he was a pupil of Scheffont, and afterwards he
worked under Isabey. At the Salon of 1852 he obtained a medal of
the first class, and then for years in succession was rejected by the
juries. Almost at the end of his life he was offered the long-coveted
decoration, but he was never a popular artist, nor even well known
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>amongst the art public. A few amateurs bought his works, his
water-colours were lost in old portfolios, and the exhibition of his
pictures previous to the sale after his death was a revelation alike to
painters and critics. His life was a sad history of neglect, terrible
privation, and want. All that we know of him is that he gave
way to alcoholism, dying in Isère in 1891, alone, friendless, and
forgotten.</p>

<p class='c021'>Jongkind was one of the very first men in France to occupy
himself with the enormous difficulties surrounding the study of
atmospheric effects, the decomposition of luminous rays, the play of
reflections, and the unceasing change crossing over the same natural
form during the different hours of the day. His influence over
several of the more prominent men of the Impressionist group was
great. Edouard Manet was strongly impressed by his methods, and
Claude Monet refers to him as a man of profound genius and originality
of character, “le grand peintre.”</p>

<p class='c021'>In the sale-rooms Jongkind’s water-colours and etchings are now
reaching very high prices, although one cannot agree that they are
his most remarkable creations. Works the artist was content to sell for
£4 to £8 now change hands under the hammer at sums ranging from
£160 to £800. The best canvases were painted towards the end of
his life, especially those depicting the luminous atmosphere of the
beautiful Dauphiné countryside. His large landscapes are extremely
unequal, somewhat hard and dry in technique, and more or less
stereotyped in the choice of subject. His pictures do not always
convey the true feeling for atmospheric effect, and many are simply
experiments which lack the great quality of charm. Without a
doubt he possessed extraordinary ability, but he lacked the illuminating
spark of genius. He pointed out a way he was not himself strong
enough to follow.</p>

<p><span class='small'>MOONRISE · J. B. JONGKIND</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Louis-Eugène Boudin, an old comrade and life-long friend of
Jongkind, is the head of the group of “little masters” who reigned
during the transitional period in French landscape art between 1830
and 1870. He was born in the Rue Bourdet, Honfleur, on July 12,
1824, and died within a few miles of his birthplace in 1898.
He leaves a magnificent record of work accomplished, and the
memory of a noble life devoted to a beautiful ideal. Pissarro, in
a letter addressed to the writer, says that Boudin had much influence
upon the advancement of the Impressionist idea, particularly through
his studies direct from Nature. His father was a pilot on board the
steamboat <i>François</i> of Havre, a bluff and hearty sailor, typical of the
coast nearly a century ago. A good specimen is to be found in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>burly guardian of the Musée Normand at Honfleur, who, by a
coincidence not altogether strange in this world of coincidences,
travelled round the world with old Boudin, and knew intimately
“le petit Eugène.”</p>

<p class='c021'>The boy’s mother was stewardess on board the boat her husband
piloted, and the artist commenced life in the humble and not
altogether enviable capacity of cabin-boy. In that position he
remained until his fourteenth year, travelling from French and
English ports as far as the Antilles. At that age an irresistible
desire came over his soul. He wished to quit seafaring life and
devote himself to the brush. He had already made many sketches
in bitumen, some having attracted attention from passengers. Those
which have been preserved display wonderful proficiency, considering
the many difficulties the boy had to labour under. Chance helped
the youth; for his father, tiring of his endless struggle with the
elements, retired from his post and opened a little stationery shop on
the Grand Quai at Havre. The cabin-boy became shop-boy.</p>

<p class='c021'>This new mode of life gave him far greater time to follow his
inclinations. All untaught he applied himself assiduously to
draughtsmanship, painting on the quays, in the streets, devoting
Sundays and fête-days to long excursions amongst the hills round
about Havre. One day Troyon brought a canvas for framing to the
elder Boudin’s shop. In the corner he noticed some curious little
pastels of the shipping and harbour. Eugène made his first artistic
friendship. Troyon, who was living in great poverty, only too
pleased to sell a picture for twenty-five francs, was of great assistance
to the lad. Another customer helped young Boudin. Norman by
birth, son of a seaman, Jean-François Millet met the boy in Havre
and was attracted by his evident skill. Millet was in the same
quandary as Troyon; stranded in semi-starvation, he was executing
portraits at thirty francs per head, diligently canvassing the retired
ebony merchants, the harbour officials, the sailors and their sweethearts.
Alphonse Karr and Courbet, whilst wandering through
Normandy, became acquainted with Boudin’s sketches, and sought
out the young artist.</p>

<p class='c021'>Eugène Boudin’s career was now determined. The advice of
friends was vain. They pointed out that if Corot with his immense
talent was unable to earn an independence at the age of fifty, an
untrained shop-boy had still less chance. No man could tell a more
bitter story of the artist’s life than Millet, and he attempted to
persuade the boy to keep to the shop. All efforts were fruitless.
Couture and a few other associates obtained a small student’s allowance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>from the Havre Town Council, and Boudin set out for Paris.
The bursary of one pound weekly soon came to an end, and left the
artist without resources or friends. He paid for his washing with a
picture valued at the sum of forty francs. The laundress immediately
sold the work to cover her bill, and the canvas has recently changed
hands for four thousand francs. His “marchand de vin” exchanged
wine for pictures which have lately passed through the sale-rooms at
forty times their original agreed values. By these means, together
with a few portrait commissions, Boudin managed to eke out a most
precarious existence.</p>

<p class='c021'>From 1856 dates the foundation of the “Ecole Saint Simeon,”
(so called from the rustic inn and farmhouse on the road from
Honfleur to Villerville, halfway up the hill overlooking Havre and
the mouth of the Seine), in which Boudin took a prominent part.
In 1857 the artist exhibited ten pictures at the local Havre
exhibition, which he followed with a sale by auction, his idea being
to raise enough money to pay his expenses back to Paris. Claude
Monet had been sending several pressing letters of invitation, holding
out fair prospects of business with several art dealers. The sale was
a complete failure, producing a net sum of £20. Boudin gave up
his hopes of Paris and returned to the farmhouse of Saint Simeon
saddened and discouraged. Roused by “la mère Toutain,” he opened
an academy of painting, and the old inn of Saint Simeon may be
called the cradle of French Impressionism.</p>

<p class='c021'>For twenty-five years it formed the resting-place, from time to
time, of all the most celebrated men of the group. The list is a long
one—Millet, Troyon, Courbet, Lepine, Diaz, Harpignies, Jongkind,
Cals, Isabye, Daubigny, Monet, and many others. Boudin always
regretted that there was no history written of the place, no record
of the scenes which took place there. One has the same regret over
many other famous sketching grounds and artistic inns in France.
What stories can be told of the joyous life, of the good fellowship,
the games and escapades, the brilliant jokes of many a world-renowned
genius in playful mood, happy little bands of men with the spirit
and souls of children!</p>

<p class='c021'>The hostesses are of a type apart, and no other country but
France produces them in such numbers. “Mères des artistes,” they
are full of pride with their anecdotes of celebrated lodgers. Peasants
of the best class, admired and respected by all who come into contact
with them, they are remembered with affection. The peaceful
holidays spent in these lovely villages represent much of the brighter
side of the art-student’s career, and memories mix with regrets as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>one recalls a youth spent in that beloved country of art—la belle
France.</p>

<p class='c021'>Boudin’s academy of painting at the inn was no great success,
and he changed his habitat to Trouville, twenty miles down the
coast, at the invitation of Isabey and the Duc de Morny. They
suggested that he should paint “scènes de plage” of that gay and
fashionable watering-place, the bathers, the frequenters of the
Casino and the racecourse, the regattas, the “landscapes of the sea”
as Courbet called them. “It is prodigious, my dear fellow; truly
you are one of the seraphim, for you alone understand the heavens,”
cried Courbet one day in excitement as he watched Boudin at work.
Boudin was at last becoming famous. Alexandre Dumas addressed
him as, “You who are master of the skies, ‘par excellence,’” and
above all came the testimony of Corot, who described him as
“le roi des ciels.”</p>

<p class='c021'>Unfortunately, the public did not buy Boudin’s pictures, and he
remained in poverty. In 1864 he married, his wife receiving a “dot”
of 2000 francs, and a home was made up four flights of rickety
stairs in a mean street in Honfleur, the rental of the garret being
thirty-five shillings per annum. Amongst their visitors the saddest
was Jongkind, the man of failure, a reproach to the blindness of his
generation, and a warning to those who seek fortune by the brush. It
was only by the combination of courage, energy, and robust health that
Boudin was able to fight his way through actual periods of starvation
in order to live to see his work justified by public appreciation.</p>

<p class='c021'>Four years later the little household was moved to Havre.
Boudin was reduced to such absolute poverty that he was not able
to provide himself with sufficient decent clothing to visit a rich
tradesman of the town, who had commissioned some decorative
panels. The commission was lost, and the fight for bread was
keener than before. During the winter furniture was converted
into firewood, and the artist worked as an ordinary labourer.
Boudin hated Paris, but at the urgent solicitation of artists, who
promised him work, he left Havre for the metropolis. Ill luck
still dogged his steps. No sooner had he settled with his wife
in the new quarters than the war broke out with all the unendurable
misfortunes of “l’année terrible” in its train.</p>

<p class='c021'>Hopes of commissions were at an end, the art colony being
scattered far and wide. Boudin fled first to Deauville, then to
Brussels. Crowded with French refugees, the struggle for life entered
its bitterest stage. For the second time Boudin became a day-labourer.
At last, by a most trifling chance, his wretched position
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>was altered for the better. By hazard Madame Boudin met a
picture-dealer whilst marketing, and his appreciation and encouragement
enabled the artist to return to his easel. The artist’s progress
was, however, extremely slow. Nine years later he held an auction
sale of his pictures, at which four paintings realised £21. A friend
who had joined in the sale was more unfortunate, for he sold
nothing. “You see,” he wrote to Boudin, “that nothing succeeds
with me. I don’t know how it will all finish. What upsets me
most in the midst of all this worry is the fear that I should lose all
love for painting.” This phrase must have represented Boudin’s
thoughts during the long years of disheartening struggle.</p>

<p class='c021'>In 1881, after twenty-three years of almost annual exhibition in
the Paris Salons, Boudin obtained a medal in the third class. Nowadays
this award is usually made to the young man who exhibits
for the first time. Three years later Boudin received a medal of
the second class, which exempted his work from judgment by the
jury, and places its recipient “hors concours.” He commenced, at
the age of fifty, to sell his pictures more regularly, but at prices
extremely low and out of proportion to their present value. At the
Hôtel Drouot, Paris, in 1888, one hundred canvases by Boudin
fetched the grand total of £280. It is difficult to estimate what
sum such a lot would reach at the present day.</p>

<p class='c021'>The tide had changed, for the Government bought a large
painting, <i>Une Corvette Russe dans le Bassin de l’Eure au Havre</i> for the
Luxembourg. In 1889, public honour was marred by the most
mournful blow. To his inconsolable grief his wife died, after
twenty-five years of the happiest companionship. Amongst the
letters of sympathy were many acknowledgments of the artist’s genius,
notably from Claude Monet, “in recognition of the advice which
has made me what I am”—a striking and flattering phrase from the
head of the Impressionist group. In this same year Boudin was
awarded the gold medal at the Salon. In 1896 the Government
purchased his <i>Rade de Villefranche</i> for the Luxembourg, and the old
artist received from the hands of Puvis de Chavannes, at the recommendation
of the Minister Léon Bourgeois, the ribbon and cross of
the Legion of Honour.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Boudin’s health, weakened by the long privations, had at last
broken up. After several futile journeys he returned to his native
Normandy, and, whilst working at his easel in his châlet near
Deauville in 1898, died almost without warning. By his will he
left a rich legacy of pictures to the gallery of his native town,
Honfleur. Over one hundred of Boudin’s sketches can now be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>seen in the public gallery of Havre. Boudin’s connection with
modern Impressionism is chiefly the influence generated by a strong
enthusiasm for working “en plein air” and a deep love of Nature.
His dominant colour, almost to the end of his life, was grey—a
grey beautiful in its range and truthful in its effect. Personally
Boudin had the head of an old pilot, with healthy ruddy complexion,
white beard, and keen blue eyes. He spoke slowly in low
monotonous tones, was doggedly tenacious of an idea, had strong
artistic convictions. He was modest to a degree, and when he
sought honours they were for brother artists, never for himself.
His highest ambition was reached when the Town Council of
Honfleur named a street “Rue Eugène-Boudin.” This street, long,
narrow, hilly, with many rough places and occasional pitfalls, typifies
the artist’s own life. After his death the town went further. Aided
by M. Gustave Cahen, president of the “Société des Amis des Arts,”
Honfleur erected a fine statue of its talented son by the jetty, where
he had so often painted his favourite scenes of sea and shipping.</p>

<p class='c021'>Boudin has left a name which will be honoured in the annals of
French art. He lived a long life, produced many works of which
not one falls below his own high standard. His position, midway
between two great schools, is perhaps one reason why he has not
loomed more strongly in the public appreciation. Upon their
merits his pictures cannot easily be forgotten. When it is remembered
that he links Corot to Monet, was in fact the true master
of the latter, it will be seen what an important niche he occupies
in any history devoted to Modern French Impressionism.</p>

<p class='c021'>From Boudin is an easy step to Cézanne, one of the pioneers of
the movement before 1870. Paul Cézanne and Zola were schoolboys
together in Aix. They left Provence to conquer Paris, and
whilst Zola was a clerk in Hachette’s publishing office Cézanne
was working out in his studio the early theories of Manet, of whom
he was an enthusiastic admirer. Both men frequented the Café
Guerbois, and there is little doubt that in the remarkable series of
articles contributed to De Villemessant’s paper “L’Événement,”
Zola was assisted by Cézanne, who had introduced the journalist to
the artists he had championed. When the criticisms were republished
in 1866, in a volume entitled “Mes Haines,” Zola dedicated the
book in affectionate terms, “A mon ami Paul Cézanne,” recalling ten
years of friendship. The writer went still further, for the character
of Claude Lantier, hero of “L’Œuvre,” a novel dealing largely with
artistic life and Impressionism, is generally supposed to have been
suggested by the personality of Paul Cézanne.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>For years Cézanne seldom exhibited, and his pictures are not
known amongst the public. As to their merits, opinion is curiously
divided. He has painted landscapes, figure compositions, and studies
of still-life. His landscapes are crude and hazy, weak in colour, and
many admirers of Impressionism find them entirely uninteresting.
His figure compositions have been called “clumsy and brutal.”
Probably his best work is to be found in his studies of still-life, yet
even in this direction one cannot help noting that his draughtsmanship
is defective. It is probable that the incorrect drawing of
Cézanne is responsible for a reproach often directed against Impressionists
as a body—a general charge of carelessness in one of the first
essentials of artistic technique. Apart from this defect, Cézanne’s
paintings of still-life have a brilliancy of colour not to be found in
his landscapes.</p>

<p class='c021'>In his student-days this artist had a great admiration for
Veronese, Rubens, and Delacroix, three masters who had some
influence upon Manet. Some of his latter methods showed a strong
sympathy with the Primitives. The modern symbolists are his
descendants, and Van Gogh, Emile Bernard, and Gauguin owe
much to his example. Personally he unites a curiously shy nature
with a temperament half-savage, half-cynical. Cézanne’s work is
remarkable for its evident sincerity, and the painter’s aim has been
to attain an absolute truth to nature. These ambitions are the
keynotes of Impressionist art.</p>

FOR over twenty years the technique and methods of
Edouard Manet were a subject for the most virulent
debate. His art, in fact, became the scene of a battle
in which every painter in Europe had a hand.
Officialdom found no place for him in its heart, no
matter whether the State was Imperial or Republican.
The Empress Eugénie once asked that his pictures might be removed
from public exhibition; President Grévy demurred when the artist’s
name was placed on the list for the Legion of Honour. Clearly this
man was no supporter of the established order of things. Refused
recognition as an artist by the school of tradition, disowned by his
own teacher, a source of hilarity to the public, Edouard Manet
caught but a glimpse of the long-wished-for land of success which
he was fated never to enjoy fully.</p>

<p class='c021'>The battle is not quite finished, and the rout of the old school
continues to the present day. One result remains. Manet has
had a greater influence upon the art of the last forty years than
any other master during that period, and the standard which he
raised has become a rallying-point for the greatest painters of the
present age.</p>

<p class='c021'>Edouard Manet was born in Paris on January 23, 1832, at No. 5, Rue des
Petits Augustins. Thirty-six years previously Corot was born round the
corner, in the Rue du Bac. To-day the Rue des Petits Augustins is a
long street running through the Latin Quarter, southwards from the
Seine and the Louvre, known as the Rue Bonaparte. It has become the
chief mart for commerce in artists’ materials, photographs, pictures,
and all the odds and ends which fill up a studio. With a quaint
appropriateness, the birthplace of Manet faces the École Nationale des
Beaux-Arts.</p>

<p class='c021'>The boy was the eldest of three brothers. His father was a
judge attached to the tribunal of the Seine, and the family had been
connected with the magistrature for generations. First a pupil at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>Vaugirard, under the Abbé Poiloup, Manet then entered the Collège
Rollin, took his baccalaureate in letters, and grew into an elegant
man of the world. But his inclinations clashed with his duties, and
his uncle, amateur artist and colonel in the artillery, taught him how
to sketch in pen and ink. M. Antonin Proust describes the result
in a recent magazine article.</p>

<p class='c021'>“From earliest years,” he writes, “Manet drew by instinct,
with a firmness of touch and vigour unexcelled even in his latest
works. His family was intensely proud of the boy’s uncommon
gift, and his artistically-inclined uncle, Colonel Fournier, supported
him against his father, who—despite his admiration—had other
views as to his son’s career.”</p>

<p class='c021'>“One should never thwart a child in the choice of his career,”
said Colonel Fournier.</p>

<p class='c021'>“If,” replied the father, “the boy is not inclined towards the
‘Palais,’ let him follow your example and become a soldier; but go
in for painting—never!”</p>

<p class='c021'>A studio-stool tempted the boy far more than a probable seat on
the Bench. If he had to waste time, it should not be in the Salle
des Pas Perdus.</p>

<p class='c021'>His parents sent him, towards the close of his school-days, upon
a voyage to Rio de Janeiro, hoping that travel might distract his
mind from thoughts of an artistic life. It is said that they contemplated
a naval career. Charles Méryon, it may be remembered,
made the voyage round the world in a French corvette before he
took up the etcher’s needle. Like Méryon, Manet improved his
draughtsmanship, although a sailor. He sketched incessantly. One
day the captain asked him to get out his paints and touch up a
cargo of Dutch cheeses, which had become discoloured by the sea.
“Conscientiously, with a brush,” says Manet, “I freshened up these
<i>têtes de mort</i>, which reappeared in their beautiful tints of violet and
red. It was my first piece of painting.”</p>

<p class='c021'>His voyage in the <i>Guadeloupe</i> ended, he returned home with
unaltered determination. After some protest his father relented, and
in 1850 Manet entered the studio of Thomas Couture.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Couture occupied a leading position in that group sometimes
called the “juste milieu.” Between the Romanticists and the
Classicalists his preferences perhaps were for the latter. Of extreme
irritability in temper, with a deep contempt for those in authority,
he combined a keen desire for success both popular and financial.
His picture, <i>The Romans of the Decadence</i>, in the Salon of 1847, brought
both, and for a few years he remained one of the most celebrated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>artists in France. Then he criticised Delaroche, with the usual
result when one painter puts another right: he offended King Louis-Philippe,
he insulted the Emperor Napoleon III. Kings must be
taken at their own valuation, if one wishes to enjoy their good graces.
It was not surprising that Couture ultimately became a disappointed
and forgotten man.</p>

<p class='c021'>He has been called an Apostle of Classicalism. Taught first
by Baron Gros, who vacillated from one school to the other,
and afterwards by Delaroche, who endeavoured to reconcile the
opposing parties, Couture could hardly have taken any other position
in the art world of the ’forties. “He was apart among the
painters of the day, as far removed from the cold academic school
as from the new art just then making its way, with Delacroix at
its head. The famous quarrel between the Classical and Romantic
camps left him indifferent. He was of too independent a nature to
follow any chief, however great.” This is the testimony of an
American artist, Mr. P. A. Healy, who studied under Couture about
the time Manet was in the atelier, and shows that the future Impressionist
worked under a man by no means curbed by tradition.
According to his pupil, Couture’s great precept was, “Look at
Nature; copy Nature.” Manet’s doctrine was couched in almost
the same words, “Do nothing without consulting Nature.”</p>

<p class='c021'>We know that during the time Manet remained in Couture’s
studio, master and pupil quarrelled incessantly. The reason usually
given is that Manet would not respect tradition. But neither
would Couture. “That in the captain’s but a choleric word, which
in the soldier is flat blasphemy.” One was there to teach, the
other to be taught. The temperaments of the two men were fundamentally
different. The thick-set, scowling Couture, of shoemaker
descent, would naturally rub against the grain of the rather dandified
young scion of the magistrature. Couture hated the middle classes,
and Manet belonged to the “haute bourgeoisie.” Manet’s family
was legal to the bone, and Couture detested lawyers even more than
he disliked doctors. With all these drawbacks Couture was admittedly
the best teacher in Paris. Manet evidently recognised the
advantage, for he remained in the studio for six years, until he was
twenty-five years of age, although quite able to sever the connection
had he wished.</p>

<p class='c021'>Then came the “wanderjahre,” which commenced in 1856.
Manet visited Germany, Holland, and Italy. In the Low Countries,
Franz Hals exerted a great and permanent influence over the student;
Rembrandt was copied in Germany; in Italy, Titian and Tintoretto
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>received his homage. Dresden, Prague, Vienna, Munich, Venice and
Florence were visited. Upon his return to Paris he copied assiduously
in the Louvre, and it was in this wonderful gallery that he so
thoroughly mastered all that a young painter could learn from the
Spanish School. He did not visit Madrid until 1865. His Spanish
subjects before that date were the result of a careful study of
Velazquez and Goya in the National Collection and the visit of an
Iberian troupe of players to Paris. In the Louvre he copied paintings
by Velazquez, Titian, and Tintoretto.</p>

<p class='c021'>Of living artists Courbet considerably influenced the first period
of Manet’s activity. Ever on the fringe of Impressionism, although
never in the group, Courbet was a romantically inclined realist who
taught the younger men to turn to everyday life for their subjects.
His canvases were full of colour; although they have sadly toned
down in the course of time, owing to the curious and unsuccessful
experiments he made in trying to combine his practice with his
theories.</p>

<p class='c021'>In 1859 Manet sent his work for the first time to the Salon.
The <i>Absinthe Drinker</i>, strong, but reminiscent of Courbet, was rejected.
The Salon was held every two years, and in 1861 both his contributions
were accepted, one being a double portrait of his father and
mother, the other a Spanish study called the <i>Guitarero</i>. For this
Manet was awarded Honourable Mention, his first and almost
his final official distinction, for he received no other until the
year before his death, twenty-one years later. Working with
tremendous energy in his studio in the Rue Lavoisier, Manet
became the centre of a circle of friends which included Legros,
Bracquemond, Jongkind, Monet, Degas, Fantin-Latour, Harpignies,
and Whistler. The Guitar-player was an undoubted success.
“<i>Caramba</i>,” writes genial Theo. Gautier, “Velazquez would
greet this fellow with a friendly little wink, and Goya would
hand him a pipe for his papelito.” Upon the jury it is said that
Ingres himself was flattering, and the <i>mention honorable</i> was ascribed
to the lead of Delacroix. Couture’s sneer that Manet would
become merely the Daumier of 1860 did not seem likely to be
justified.</p>

<p class='c021'>Manet was now engaged upon several pictures which must not
be ignored. <i>Music at the Tuileries</i> (1861), refused at the Salon, was,
as its name implies, an open-air study of the fashionable crowds
gathered round the bandstand in the lovely gardens by the palace.
The <i>Street Singer</i> is the earliest of the almost realistic renderings
of everyday life which the Impressionists delighted in. A sad-faced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>girl (a well-known character of the day) standing with a guitar
at a street corner; the type is the same to this hour both in London
and Paris, one of the thousand wretched beings superfluous to a
great city, at once its pleasure and its sport.</p>

<p class='c021'><i>The Boy with a Sword</i>, now in the Metropolitan Museum of New
York, also belongs to this period. The picture is masterly. Inspired
from Spain, it is, like most great paintings, full of simplicity, full of
strength. <i>The Old Musician</i> is also extremely Spanish, with a haunting
reminiscence of <i>Los Borrachos</i> by Velazquez (although Manet
had not yet directly seen this canvas). A small group watches an
old man about to play his fiddle. Some boys, a little girl with a
doll (a figure very dear to Manet), a man drinking, a native of the
Orient in a turban and a long robe, these form a straggling composition.
The picture is a fantasy of a nation the painter loved but had
never yet seen.</p>

<p class='c021'>Two personal matters affected the life of Manet about this time.
His father died, leaving him a considerable private fortune, thus
making the artist financially independent of dealers and the ups and
downs of public exhibition. In 1863 he married Mlle. Suzanne
Leenhoff, a Dutch lady of great musical talent. From one point of
view 1863 was disastrous, from another triumphant. Hitherto a
man of promise, Manet now developed into a man of notoriety.</p>

<p class='c021'>The little “one-man show” at the gallery of M. Martinet,
Boulevard des Italiens, presaged the coming storm. Manet exhibited
the <i>Spanish Ballet</i>, <i>Music at the Tuileries</i>, <i>Lola de Valence</i>, and nearly
the whole of his other work up to that date. Baudelaire was
enthusiastic. Verses on <i>Lola de Valence</i> are enshrined in “Fleurs
de Mal.” Other critics were not so kind. M. Paul Mantz did not
restrain his pen and referred to “a struggle between noisy, plastery
tones, and black,” with a result “hard, sinister, and deadly,” the
whole summed up as “a caricature of colour.”</p>

<p class='c021'>The Salon of 1863, which followed, has become famous not
through what it accepted, but by reason of what it refused. In a
contemporary chronicle the most notable pictures of the exhibition
are <i>La Prière au Désert</i> by Gustave Guillaumet, a <i>Sainte Famille</i> by
Bouguereau, <i>La Déroute</i> by Gustave Boulanger, <i>La Bataille de Solférino</i>
by Meissonier, and the <i>Chasse au Renard</i> by Courbet. With the
exception of Courbet it is an academical list, although it is extraordinary
how Courbet crept in.</p>

<p class='c021'>The list of rejected artists is amazing. Like Herod’s soldiers,
the jury seems to have been chiefly occupied in stamping out youth.
Bracquemond, Cals, Cazin, Fantin-Latour, Harpignies, Jongkind,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>J. P. Laurens, Legros, Manet, Pissarro, Vallon, Whistler, these and
many others were thrown out. The work was too vigorously
performed, and Napoleon III. authorised the opening of another
gallery in the same building as the old Salon, known as the Salon des
Refusés. The most striking canvas in this room was Manet’s first
great work, the <i>Déjeuner sur l’Herbe</i> (<i>Breakfast on the Grass</i>), sometimes
called <i>Le Bain</i>.</p>

<p class='c021'>The painting challenged opposition on two separate grounds.
The first was its subject; the second its technique. Between two
young men stretched on the grass, wearing the black frock-coats of
a latter-day civilisation, sits a nude woman drying her legs with a
towel. In the background another woman “en chemise” is paddling
in the stream. In defence of such a subject it is usual to refer to the
painters of the Renaissance, who, without exciting angry comment,
mixed draped and undraped figures in their compositions. There
is a celebrated Giorgione at the Louvre to which none objected.
Other times, other manners. Infanticide is not encouraged in
England although it is the practice in China. Many social practices
of the Renaissance, innocent enough in the eyes of that golden age,
are distinctly discouraged by the criminal code of to-day. Forty
years have elapsed since the <i>Déjeuner sur l’Herbe</i> was first exhibited,
and Mrs. Grundy is not the power she was. But if any English
painter hung a representation of two dressmaker’s assistants bathing
in the Serpentine under exactly the same conditions as Manet
depicted the little party at Saint-Ouen, there would be some sharp
criticism.</p>

<p class='c021'>It is far more pleasing to discuss Manet’s manner of painting.
In a period when work was sombre in tone and Nature rapidly losing
her place in art, Manet with his <i>Déjeuner sur l’Herbe</i>, <i>Olympia</i>, and
<i>Le Fifre de la Garde</i>, changed the current with startling directness.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>In these and other canvases there was not a shadow, the surface
being from end to end clear and highly coloured. Where a Classicalist
would have rendered a shadow in the usual burnt umber, Manet
made his tones a little less clear, but always coloured and always in
value. His method of working was to discard all blacks and preparations
of blacks. This was directly antagonistic to the teaching
of Couture, who painted on a black canvas. Manet drew straight
away on a white canvas with the end of his brush. Then, after
having endeavoured to render with a single tone all the pale parts,
he carried the lights right into the shadows, of which he studied the
slightest nuance. The result was novel to the vision, and strange
to the public. The <i>Déjeuner sur l’Herbe</i> was a masterly rendering of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>white flesh against black clothes, which was not appreciated because
it was so foreign to the eye.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c023'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Be not the first by whom the new is tried,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Nor yet the last to lay the old aside,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c024'>is an excellent motto for painters who wish to achieve popular
renown, but it was never the motto of Manet and the Impressionists.</p>
<p class='c013'>To a certain extent the Salon des Refusés was successful. The
jury of the old Salon had received a fright, and in 1865 they opened
their doors very widely. Making a virtue of necessity, they reversed
their policy and welcomed the whole artistic world, in order to obviate
the necessity of a second Salon des Refusés.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Olympia</i> was far in advance of anything the artist had yet attempted.
In composition it recalls Velazquez, Goya, and Titian. A girl,
anæmic and decidedly unprepossessing, quite nude, is stretched upon a
couch covered with an Indian shawl of yellowish tint. Behind is a
negress, with a bouquet of flowers. At the foot of the bed a black
cat strikes a sharp note of colour against the white linen.</p>

<p class='c013'>Gautier and Barbey D’Aurevilly—both men of exotic genius—received
the painting with great favour. They found themselves alone
in their opinions. Again the subject displeased the crowd, whilst the
extraordinary technique exasperated the art world. Even Courbet,
reformer as he was, repudiated it. “It is flat and lacks modelling.
It looks like the queen of spades coming out of a bath.” Manet
retorted: “He bores us with his modelling. Courbet’s idea of
rotundity is a billiard-ball.” The general verdict, however, was
one in which ridicule and mockery were equally mixed. A
religious picture, <i>Christ reviled by the Soldiers</i>, received no greater
encouragement, and in the next Salon Manet was rejected without
mercy. <i>Le Fifre de la Garde</i> and <i>The Tragic Actor</i> were both refused.
He had provoked such fierce animosity that he was even excluded
from the representative exhibition of French art included in the
Universal Exhibition of 1867.</p>

<p class='c013'>Luckily, no longer dependent for money on his art, Manet was able
to exhibit under more favourable circumstances. Like Rodin a few
years ago, Manet opened a large gallery in the Avenue de l’Alma,
which he shared with Courbet. Here he collected fifty works,
including the <i>Boy with the Sword</i>, several Spanish subjects, seascapes,
portraits, studies of still life, aquafortes, even copies. A catalogue
was issued containing a short introduction. “The artist does not say
to you to-day, Come and see flawless works, but, Come and see
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>sincere works.” Another sentence shares with a title of Claude
Monet’s the origin of the generic phrase, “Impressionism.” “It is
the effect of sincerity to give to a painter’s works a character that
makes them resemble a protest, whereas the painter has only thought
of rendering his impression.” Manet never considered himself as a
man in revolt.</p>

<p class='c013'>The artist had now a considerable following, and was supported
by several vigorous pens in the press, notably that wielded by Emile
Zola, who had been introduced to Manet by an old school friend
become artist, Cézanne. Zola’s campaign in 1866, following upon
the rejection by the Salon of the <i>Fifre de la Garde</i>, saw some hard
fights. Zola saluted Manet as the greatest artist of the age, and
incidentally overturned a few pedestals in the Academy. Animosity
directed against the artist was transferred to the journalist, and Zola
was soon ejected from his position under M. de Villemessant as art critic
to the <i>Figaro</i> (then famous as <i>l’Événement</i>). Artists of the old
school used to buy copies of this journal containing the offending
articles, seek out Zola or Manet on the boulevards, and then destroy
the paper under their eyes with every manifestation of scorn.</p>

<p class='c013'>About this time the gatherings in the Café Guerbois, in the
Rue Guyot, behind the Parc Monceau, were held twice a week
regularly, and the School of Batignolles became an established fact.
The group was mixed, and held together more through comradeship
than through identical aims. It included Whistler, Legros, Fantin-Latour,
Monet, Degas (a young man fresh from the Ecole des Beaux
Arts), Duranty, Zola, Vignaux, sometimes Proust, Henner, and
Alfred Stevens. To these names should be added Pissarro, Sisley,
Renoir, Bazille, and Cézanne. Monet had been attracted by Manet
since the little exhibition at Monsieur Martinet’s in 1863, although
they did not meet until 1866, the year that Camille Pissarro joined
the camp. Fantin-Latour was an old chum, the friendship commencing
in 1857, and he commemorated these gatherings in a picture
of the members of the group, which attracted much attention in the
Salon of 1870.</p>

<p><span class='small'>PORTRAIT OF M. P——, THE LION-HUNTER · EDOUARD MANET</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The home life of Edouard Manet was strangely different from
what one would expect of such an artist, so notorious in the Paris
of the Empire that when he entered a café its frequenters turned to
stare at the incomer. Manet lived with his wife and his mother in
the Rue St. Pétersbourg. The old lady, faithful to her remembrance
of the age of Charles X. and the Citizen King, lived amidst
souvenirs of the past. Modernity was entirely absent from the little
household, and those who anticipated evidences of the spirit of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>revolution which characterised Manet in the world of the boulevards
here discovered the atmosphere, even the decoration and furniture,
of the Louis-Philippe period. Romance had also entered into the
hitherto prosaic Manet family. Mlle. Berthe Morisot, a clever
young artist from Bourges, had married Manet’s brother Eugène, and
became an ardent follower of her brother-in-law’s artistic doctrines,
whom she aided frequently.</p>

<p class='c013'>A famous work of this period is <i>The Execution of the Emperor
Maximilian</i>, the subject representing a file of dark-hued Mexicans
shooting the unfortunate monarch. It is a vast canvas, slightly
inconsistent with many of the artist’s theories. Not lacking in
actuality (it was commenced within a few months of the event), it
was of historical <i>genre</i> and painted in a studio from models, the face
of the Emperor being copied from a photograph. Rarely, if ever
before, seen in London, this magnificent painting was received
enthusiastically when exhibited at the first collection made by the
International Society in 1898.</p>

<p class='c013'>In France the authorities forbade the public exhibition of the
<i>Execution</i>, the tragedy having had too intimate a relation with French
politics; but at the Salon of 1869 Manet was represented by <i>The
Balcony</i>, which provoked considerable derision from critics and
public.</p>

<p class='c013'>The famous duel with Duranty took place early in the following
year. Duranty, an old friend and journalistic supporter of the
movement, of great literary reputation in the ’sixties and ’seventies,
but quite forgotten now, suddenly published a newspaper article in
which the artist was violently attacked. There was no palpable
reason for such a strange outbreak, and at the next gathering at the
Café Guerbois, Manet requested explanations. In his anger the
artist struck the writer across the face. Manet had for seconds Zola
and Vigniaux, and his adversary was slightly wounded in the breast.
Within a few years Manet stretched out his hand in friendship, and
the quarrel was made up and forgotten by both parties.</p>

<p class='c013'>The tremendous upheaval of the year 1870 had its effect upon
Manet’s art, as it had upon the whole national and intellectual life of
France. It marks the end of his first period, for after the war Manet
paid more attention to the question of lighting, and gathered closer
to the little group of “Luminarists” of which Claude Monet was
the most significant figure. Early in 1870 the artist, when painting
near Paris, in the park of his friend De Nittis, for the first time
woke up to the prime importance of working “en plein air.” The
war intervened, and Manet served with the colours. After the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>campaign he returned to his easel, but no longer an exclusive
follower of the Spanish School and the Romanticists of the type of
Courbet.</p>

<p class='c013'>At the call of their country, artists and authors alike followed the
flag. One can still remember how short-sighted Alphonse Daudet
kept sentry-go during the first awful winter, and how, almost at the
end of the siege of Paris, the brilliant Henri Regnault was shot down
in a sortie. Bastien-Lepage was in the field, and one of the group of
the Café Guerbois, Bazille, was killed in action. Manet enlisted in
the Garde Nationale, and, for some reason which is not obvious,
was at once promoted to the Staff. Unfortunately, Meissonier was
nominated Colonel of the same regiment, which shows that the
État-Major was quite ignorant of the state of contemporary art.
Meissonier, a man of strong opinions, the recognised head of his
profession, member of the Institute, was covered with official
honour. Manet, with equally forcible convictions, the hero of the
Salon des Refusés, was pariah to the Academy. It was not likely
that two such men could get on well together.</p>

<p class='c013'>Some years afterwards Manet displayed his feelings. He was
gazing in a public gallery at a <i>Charge of Cuirassiers</i>, recently painted
by Meissonier. A crowd gathered round. His criticism was short.
“It’s good, really good. Everything is in steel except the cuirasses.”
The <i>mot</i> travelled round the town, and duly reached the ears of the
venerable artist at Passy. Manet saw active service. He was under
fire at the Battle of Champigny, and also took part in the suppression
of the Commune. A vivid little sketch by Manet shows a Parisian
street, after some sharp fighting with the insurgents. It may be
found reproduced in Duret’s monograph. Broken down in health,
Manet joined his mother and sister at their retreat in the Pyrenees,
and at Oléron painted the <i>Battle of the “Kearsage” and “Alabama,”</i>
a wonderful piece of sea-painting, although executed far from the
actual scene of the engagement.</p>

<p><span class='small'>EDOUARD MANET</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Manet had exhausted the paternal inheritance and was living
on the fruits of his labour. The Impressionist School, as we now
know it, was at the height of its activity, but by no means at
the summit of its success. It assumed as its title the designation
which had been applied to it as a nickname. The origin of this
title is obscure. As already mentioned, Manet used the term in his
introduction to the catalogue of 1867. Claude Monet named one
of his pictures, a sunset, exhibited in the Salon des Refusés, “Impressions.”
Ruskin though had used the same term years before in
describing a canvas by Turner. Many of the members of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>group were in the most abject poverty until the celebrated dealer,
M. Durand-Ruel, came to their assistance. Manet had better sales
than the rest of his brethren, for several collectors began to buy
from his easel, viz. Gérard, Faure (of the Opera), Hecht, Ephrussi,
Bernstein, May, and De Bellis. It is characteristic of the man that
in his own studio he exhibited the works of his friends in order that
the wealthy buyers he was beginning to attract should also invest in
the productions of the less fortunate Impressionists.</p>

<p class='c013'>In 1873 Manet contributed to the Salon a portrait of the
engraver Belot seated in the Café Guerbois. Known as <i>Le Bon Bock</i>,
it was his most popular success both with public and critics. Over
eighty sittings were given before the canvas was completed. Manet
had departed far from the technique of the Dutch portrait-painters,
but <i>Le Bon Bock</i> strongly suggests the manner of Hals, although
ranking on its own merits as an independent triumph. To the year
of <i>Le Bon Bock</i> succeeded a long period of public indifference and
artistic warfare. The Impressionists held their first collective
exhibition, which was bitterly disappointing in its results. The
public had changed but little. <i>The Opera Ball</i> and <i>The Lady with
Fans</i> (about 1873), the <i>Railway</i>, painted wholly in the open air,
and <i>Polichinelle</i> (exhibited at the Salon of 1874), <i>The Artist</i> and
<i>L’Argenteuil</i> of 1875, all were received with disfavour.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is extremely curious to note how canvases which appear to-day
perfectly normal in their methods and aims positively outraged the
feelings of critics thirty years ago. <i>L’Artiste</i>, a magnificent portrait
of the engraver Desboutins, was refused by the Salon together with
<i>Le Linge</i>. <i>L’Argenteuil</i>, a simple representation of two life-sized figures
by the borders of the Seine, would be received with acclamation
instead of disdain. Manet and his group were undoubtedly educating
the public, but progress was very slow. There was an outburst of
opinion in favour of the artist when the Salon refused <i>L’Artiste</i> and
<i>Le Linge</i>. One sentence of criticism summed up the general feeling of
those who were not entirely prejudiced against the new spirit. “The
jury is at liberty to say that it does not like Manet. But it is not at
liberty to cry ‘Down with Manet! To the doors with Manet!’”</p>

<p class='c013'>Reaction on the part of the jury followed, exactly as it had
followed in previous years. After the success of the Salon des
Refusés Manet was accepted. Then, being rejected, he opened the
gallery of the Avenue d’Alma, and was hung by the jury at the ensuing
Salon. Rejected in 1876, the outcry in the press surprised the
jury, who accepted his works in 1877. These extraordinary ups
and downs culminated in 1878, when the jury of the Exposition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>Universelle, held in that year, definitely refused to hang any of his
canvases. In the opinion of this jury the painter of <i>Le Bon Bock</i>
was not a representative French artist. Ten years had changed the
official art world but little, for the same thing had happened in
1867. This was almost the last insult Manet had to endure. In
1881 he received a second medal at the Salon. The discussion in
the Committee had been acrimonious, but seventeen members of the
jury were found to support the award. Amongst the names of the
majority are those of Carolus-Duran, Cazin, Henner, Lalanne, de
Neuville, and Roll.</p>

<p class='c013'>One cannot deny that Manet’s work greatly varied. The
portrait of M. Faure, in the character of Hamlet, was to a certain
extent conventional studio-painting, and could offend nobody. The
subject would not provoke the most susceptible. M. Faure was
celebrated on the stage of the Grand Opera, possessed considerable
wealth, and was one of Manet’s most devoted friends. <i>Nana</i>, sent to
the Salon together with the portrait of M. Faure, was rejected. The
technique was brilliant, but the subject, although harmless enough,
suggested Zola’s heroine. Zola’s book was not published until 1879,
but the name designated a class apart.</p>

<p class='c013'>In 1880 Manet exhibited a wonderful portrait of M. Antonin
Proust, and in the December of the following year his old friend,
now Directeur des Beaux-Arts, was able to give to his life-long
companion the Cross of the Legion of Honour. Had Manet no
friends at Court, he would certainly not have received this coveted
decoration. President Grévy objected when he saw the painter’s
name, and would have struck out Manet from the list had not
Gambetta exerted some little pressure.</p>

<p class='c013'>But the struggle was nearly ended. Manet was dying. “This
war to the knife has done me much harm,” he is reported to have
told Antonin Proust. “I have suffered from it greatly, but it has
whipped me up.... I would not wish that any artist should be
praised and covered with adulation at the outset, for that means the
annihilation of his personality.”</p>

<p class='c013'>On New Year’s Day, 1882, he received the Cross, and at the
Salon exhibited <i>Un Bar aux Folies-Bergères</i>, a barmaid enshrined
amidst her glasses at a Paris music-hall, and a portrait, <i>Jeanne</i>.
Since 1879 paralysis had been slowly sapping his powers. Edouard
Manet died near Paris on April 30, 1883, at the early age of fifty-one.
Disappointment, injured pride, lack of appreciation, continued and
strong hostility, each had had its effect upon a physique always
sensitive and never too strong. The artist had died for his art.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>The secret of Manet’s power is sincerity and individuality;
his main effort was a rendering of fact; his deepest interest the
truthful juxtaposition of values, the broad and simple treatment
of planes, combined with a constant search for the character of the
person or object portrayed.</p>

<p class='c013'>The influences which guided Manet during the earlier portion of
his career have been noticed at length. He travelled extensively,
and his works bear many souvenirs of foreign masters. But sufficient
stress is not always laid upon the influences at work around Manet
in Paris, namely, the influences of Delacroix, Corot, and the men of
1830, who carried but one stage farther the methods and tradition
of the English masters, Constable, Bonington, Girtin and Turner.</p>

<p class='c013'>Apart from sources of inspiration Manet was personally gifted.
He possessed (as M. Duret so well points out) the faculty of sight,
a gift from Nature which cannot be acquired by will or work.
Technique he had obtained after six years’ hard study in the most
severe atelier in Paris. But technique is a subsidiary equipment, for
a complete command over one’s materials does not always imply the
possession of genius.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The fools!” said Manet with bitterness to Proust. “They
were for ever telling me my work was unequal. That was the
highest praise they could bestow. Yet it was always my ambition
to rise—not to remain on a certain level, not to remake one day what
I had made the day before, but to be inspired again and again by a
new aspect of things, to strike frequently a fresh note.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah! I’m before my time. A hundred years hence people will
be happier, for their sight will be clearer than ours to-day.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Ambition to rise, never to remain on the same level! That is
the whole doctrine of art, and the supreme epitaph for Edouard
Manet, pioneer and master.</p>

THE outbreak of the Franco-German War in 1870
scattered far and wide the little group that congregated
at the Café Guerbois, and had a curious effect
upon the evolution of their methods of painting.
Several of the leading members of the circle crossed
to England, and the studies they pursued in London
formed the basis for the unconventional departures which have
produced the masterpieces of Modern Impressionism. Practically
all the later developments of their art date from the above-named
year, and if a place of genesis be sought for it will be found in the
London National Gallery.</p>

<p class='c021'>As related in a previous chapter, Edouard Manet, the acknowledged
head at the Café Guerbois gatherings, became a captain in
the Garde Nationale, with Meissonier as his colonel. Boudin and
Jongkind fled to Belgium, and became labourers. Monet, Pissarro,
Bonvin, Daubigny, and some friends, braved the horrors of “La
Manche” and settled in London. They arrived almost penniless,
thoroughly disheartened by the terrible events which were threatening
their motherland with disaster. The journey, momentous to
the unhappy passengers, was the opening of a new epoch in art.</p>

<p class='c021'>The following letter from Pissarro, to the author, written in
November 1902, gives an interesting account of their doings in
London. He says: “In 1870 I found myself in London with
Monet, and we met Daubigny and Bonvin. Monet and I were very
enthusiastic over the London landscapes. Monet worked in the
parks, whilst I, living at Lower Norwood, at that time a charming
suburb, studied the effects of fog, snow, and springtime. We worked
from Nature, and later on Monet painted in London some superb
studies of mist. We also visited the museums. The water-colours
and paintings of Turner and of Constable, the canvases of Old Crome,
have certainly had influence upon us. We admired Gainsborough,
Lawrence, Reynolds, &amp;c., but we were struck chiefly by the landscape-painters,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>who shared more in our aim with regard to “plein
air,” light, and fugitive effects. Watts, Rossetti, strongly interested
us amongst the modern men. About this time we had the idea
of sending our studies to the exhibition of the Royal Academy.
Naturally we were rejected.”</p>

<p class='c021'>“Naturally we were rejected!” These poor exiles were offering
to the conservative Academy canvases painted in a method that
Constable could not get accepted forty years before.</p>

<p class='c021'>Their admiration of Turner and Constable was a repetition of
the experiences of another great Frenchman nearly fifty years earlier.
In his published journal, Delacroix has written: “Constable and
Turner are true reformers.” At the Salon of 1824 the pictures of
Constable so profoundly impressed him that he completely repainted
his large canvas, the <i>Massacre of Scio</i>, then hanging in the same
exhibition. The next year he visited London in order that he
might more closely study Constable’s work. He returned to Paris
marvelling at the hitherto unsuspected splendour of Turner, Wilkie,
Lawrence, and Constable. Immediately he began to profit by their
examples. Delacroix chronicles that he noticed that Constable,
instead of painting in the usual flat tones, composed his picture of
innumerable touches of different colours juxtaposed, and, at a certain
distance, recomposing in a more powerful and more atmospheric
natural effect. He adds that he considers this new method far
superior to the old-fashioned one.</p>

<p class='c021'>The group of 1870 made this discovery afresh. It is pleasant
to imagine that these artistic explorations somewhat dulled the
misery of their exile. They worked and copied in the public and
private galleries, they painted by the riverside, and in the streets and
parks. With enthusiasm they absorbed the technique of Turner
and Constable, perhaps of Watts, and the result is to be seen in
Claude Monet’s <i>Haystacks</i>, in Pissarro’s street scenes, in Sisley’s landscapes,
in the luminous work of Guillaumin and d’Espagnat, in the
canvases of Vuillard, Maufra, and many followers. Their style was
revolutionised, their ideals changed. The dull greys and the russet
browns which reigned supreme before 1870 were banished for ever.</p>

<p><span class='small'>THE WHITE RABBITS · GEORGES D’ESPAGNAT</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>They returned to France the preachers of a new crusade. The
“Café de la Nouvelle Athénée” became the centre of the group.
Reunited under Manet, whose style commenced to show signs of
much influence from Claude Monet, the reformers gathered many
recruits, and gained more enemies. They were not without friends
on the press: Emile Zola, who had written so eloquently in
“Mes Haines,” Théodore Duret, friend and literary executor of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>Manet, Gustave Geffroy of “La Vie Artistique,” in Monet’s opinion
the most slashing of the lot, Arsène Alexandre of “Le Figaro,”
Gustave Cahen, Roger Marx, and many others.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='small'>A SUMMER AFTERNOON · GEORGES D’ESPAGNAT</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>But the financial position of the whole group was exceedingly
precarious. They could not sell their pictures. It was admitted
that the canvases of such men as Monet and Pissarro were the
works of men of genius, but the buying public (and they are
numerous in France) did not understand the new movement, and so
failed to support it adequately. As a whole, it may be said that the
art public were in open hostility to Impressionism. With a few
exceptions, the critics of the established art journals condemned the
movement. Even comic singers ridiculed the painters in the
music-halls of Paris. The Salon was closed against them, and the
dealers refused to look at their canvases.</p>

<p class='c021'>Meanwhile the artists starved. These were the evil days of
evictions, of visits from the sheriff, of the forced sale of household
furniture to pay insignificant debts. It is a sordid story of a struggle
to obtain the barest necessities of existence. These wretched years
proved a bitter chastening of the spirit to proud and refined natures.
Tragedy and comedy were intermixed. Glimpses of hope and
comfort appeared from time to time as some fresh buyer appeared
on the scene. But these welcome callers were not frequent, and
the rifts of sunshine through the grey clouds were, as a rule,
transitory.</p>

<p class='c021'>The artists did not over-value their works. They were able to
live in tranquillity if their pictures fetched prices ranging from
£2 to £4. To sell a canvas at £8 was an event, and £20 was
a figure absolutely unheard of. A letter from Manet, a comparatively
rich man with an independent income, to Théodore
Duret, the critic, gives a vivid insight into the situation in 1875.
Manet had recently visited Claude Monet at Argenteuil. “Dear
Duret,” he writes, “I went to see Monet yesterday. I found
him altogether ‘hard up.’ He asked me if I knew of a purchaser
for ten or twenty of his pictures at £4 each. Shall we take it on?
I thought of a dealer, or of an amateur, but there I foresee the
possibility of refusals. It is unfortunate that it is only connoisseurs,
like ourselves, who can at the same time—in spite of all the repugnance
we may feel over it—make an excellent bargain and help a
man of such talent. Answer as quickly as possible or make an
appointment with me. Amitiés, Edouard Manet.”</p>

<p class='c021'>This is good proof, if proof were needed, of the straits to
which one of the leaders of the group was reduced. It is also odd
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>to note that Manet was afraid of a refusal, from both dealers and
collectors, to the offer of such a bargain as a score of works by Claude
Monet at £4 apiece. The letter also proves that those professional
dealers who had hitherto supported the Impressionists were at the
end of their resources, notably M. Durand-Ruel.</p>

<p class='c021'>This celebrated dealer and collector had brought himself to the
verge of bankruptcy through a too generous investment in Impressionist
work. He was gradually ostracised by brother dealers,
buyers, and art critics. He was regarded in much the same light as
the artists themselves, considered to have lost his mental balance and
also his acumen as a man of business. Certainly he speculated upon
a large scale. In January 1872, having previously bought two
studies, M. Durand-Ruel called upon Manet at his studio and bought
on the spot twenty-eight canvases for the sum of 38,600 francs
(£1544). The whole Impressionist camp went wild with joy under
the mistaken idea that their millennium had arrived. They had
many years to wait. Both the pictures and the capital were locked
up for a considerable time. The public had yet to be educated,
and the few amateurs who bought Impressionist work could select
examples in abundance from the artists’ easels.</p>

<p class='c021'>It is to the credit of the group that they followed their ideals
and refused many temptations. Several of them, Monet in particular,
were admirable portraitists, and could easily have gained a very
respectable living from that branch of art. A writer in one of the
French art reviews asserts that Claude Monet’s <i>Femme à la Robe Verte</i>
was the finest painting in the Salon of 1866. Only men who have
passed through such experiences can appreciate at its true value the
heroic courage, faith, and self-confidence required during such a
trial.</p>

</div>

<p class='c021'>The ordeal was long and severe. It included public disdain and
private poverty. The movement did not, however, remain stationary.
In 1874 a small exhibition was organised, and held, from April 15
to May 15, at the galleries of M. Nadar, 35 Boulevard des
Capucines. This little salon, entitled “L’Exposition des Impressionistes,”
has become historic. The list of exhibitors included
the following: Astruc, Attendu, Béliard, Boudin, Bracquemond,
Brandon, Bureau, Cals, Cézanne, Gustave Colin, Debras, Degas,
Guillaumin, Latouche, Lepic, Lépine, Levert, Meyer, de Molins,
Monet, Berthe Morisot, Mulot-Durivage, de Nittis, Auguste Ottin,
Léon Ottin, Pissarro, Renoir, Rouart, Robert, Sisley. From every
point of view, except that of art, the exhibition was a failure.
The press attacked it with exceptional virulence, the public kept
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>away. The artists were lampooned in idiotic cartoons, and branded
as traitors who were disloyal to the artistic traditions of their
country. The public sales at the Hôtel Drouot were disastrous.
In March 1875, excellent examples of Claude Monet were sold at
prices varying between £6 and £13. Pictures by Mlle. Berthe
Morisot fetched from £3 to £19, and by Sisley from £2 to £12.
Renoir was the most unfortunate. Out of twenty paintings, ten did
not reach £4 each. Not one sold for more than £12.</p>

<p class='c021'>The particulars of the following exhibitions and sales are fully
detailed by M. Gustave Geffroy in his “Vie Artistique.” The
second exhibition was held at the house of M. Durand-Ruel in
April 1876. The participators were Béliard, Legros, Pissarro,
Bureau, Lepic, Renoir, Caillebotte, Levert, Rouart, Cals, J.-B. Millet,
Sisley, Degas, Claude Monet, Tillot, Desboutin, Berthe Morisot,
Jacques François, and the younger Ottin.</p>

<p class='c021'>In 1877 a sale was held, but prices showed little improvement.
An exhibition had been held a month previously, the
exhibitors being Caillebotte, Cals, Cézanne, Cordey, Degas, Guillaumin,
François, Lamy, Levert, Maureau, Monet, Berthe Morisot,
Piette, Pissarro, Renoir, Rouart, Sisley, and Tillot.</p>

<p class='c021'>These lists are exceedingly interesting, as they show year by year
the composition of the group. In succeeding years fresh names
appeared. In 1879, at the Spring Exhibition in the Avenue de
l’Opéra, the catalogue included Bracquemond, Marie Bracquemond,
Caillebotte, Cals, Mary Cassatt, Degas, Forain, Lebourg, Monet,
Pissarro, Rouart, Somm, Tillot, and Zandomeneghi. In 1880, at
the gallery in the Rue des Pyramides, the same names appeared,
together with J. F. Raffaëlli, J. M. Raffaëlli, Vidal, and Vignon.
Claude Monet does not appear to have sent any works, probably
because of his “one-man show” at “La Vie Moderne” gallery. In
April 1881, the annual collection began to decline in numbers,
canvases being sent by Mary Cassatt, Berthe Morisot, Degas,
Forain, Gauguin, Guillaumin, Pissarro, Raffaëlli, Rouart, Tillot,
Vidal, Vignon, and Zandomeneghi. In the following year (at the
Rue Saint-Honoré) the number was still less, Caillebotte, Gauguin,
Guillaumin, Monet, Berthe Morisot, Pissarro, Renoir, Sisley, and
Vignon. Practically the last collective exhibition was held in 1886,
the catalogue consisting of works by Degas, Berthe Morisot,
Gauguin, Guillaumin, Zandomeneghi, Forain, Mary Cassatt,
Odilon Redon, Camille Pissarro, Seurat, Signac, and Lucien
Pissarro.</p>

<p class='c021'>M. Geffroy refers to these exhibitions as battle-fields. Campaigns
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>cannot last for ever, and victory had at last crowned the
Impressionists. To-day these artists are honoured and decorated,
their works hang in public galleries over the whole world. It may
be said that we are all Impressionists now. Certainly of the students
it is true, for ninety per cent. of those who take up landscape painting
follow with admiration the paths of the Impressionists.
A glance through the annual salons, either in Europe or America,
fully proves the assertion. Before many years have elapsed, even in
England, one will find this the case. The difficulty of Hanging
Committees will be, not to hide away Impressionist work to the
least damage of its surroundings, but to hang the anecdotal, moral,
and all canvases of like <i>genre</i>, in such obscure corners as will
give the least offence to their moribund and conservative creators.</p>

CLAUDE MONET is one of the few fortunate
painters whose fame is not posthumous, and whose
material recompense runs parallel with the merit of
their production. He, above all others, has lifted
the School of Impressionism in France from the
derision and disrepute which greeted its inception
some thirty years ago, and to him is due the honour of making it
one of the most prominent of latter-day art movements.</p>

<p class='c021'>The present generation witnesses the triumph of a remarkable
revolution, and the success of a group of painters, of which Monet
was head, after years of acrimonious struggle against a world of
prejudice and disdain. Claiming a right to exercise their art as they
thought fit, aided by a mere handful of far-sighted critics and
patrons, for thirty years they patiently endured public obloquy.
Now the Luxembourg Gallery enlarges its space to receive their
works, and before long they will be represented side by side with
the masters of the Louvre. Appreciation is the order of the day,
and millionaires compete for their canvases.</p>

<p class='c021'>The life-history of Claude Monet is inseparably connected with
the story of Impressionism in France. As a leader of the little group
any record of the subject must largely consider his part in the result.
It is remarkable that a man of such talent should remain comparatively
unknown in England, considering that another portion of the
Anglo-Saxon world has always generously encouraged him. For
the past twenty years a large proportion of his works has gone to
the United States. The English nation will have to pay dearly in
the future for its present neglect of modern French art. At the
present moment there is not a single specimen of the work of Monet
on exhibition in any English public art gallery.</p>

<p class='c021'>Claude Monet was born in Paris on November 14, 1840. Son
of a wealthy merchant of Havre, his inclinations towards art were
soon shown, and these tendencies, as usual, discouraged at home.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>No member of the family had any artistic gifts, and, as in the case of
Edouard Manet, the youth was sent on a foreign tour. His school
work was spasmodic and irregular, and he devoted much of his time
at Havre to caricature and the company of Boudin the painter.
When remonstrated with his reply was the historic, “I would like
to paint as a bird sings.”</p>

<p class='c021'>After two years of military service with the Chasseurs d’Afrique
in Algeria, Monet caught fever, and returned home. He then
entered the Atélier Gleyre, and remained in Paris. Of personal
history there is little to relate. He is a man of high purpose, greatly
talented, excessively active and self-reliant, who has not faltered once
from the path of his ideals. His adventures have been those usual
to the profession of a landscape-painter. He has suffered from fever
and rheumatism, the results of working near mosquito-haunted
marshes, in drenching rain, or in damp grass. The occupation is
peaceful enough, the diseases named are of everyday occurrence, yet
they exert a powerful influence upon the life of a man for ever
engaged with brain and eye, with nerves strung to the most intense
pitch.</p>

<p class='c021'>His early struggles were the ordinary struggles of nine-tenths of
those votaries who worship at the shrines of Art. Claude Monet
has drunk deeply of the bitterness of life. He has endured privations
and disappointments which have brought him almost to the
depths of despair. He has survived only through his indomitable
pluck.</p>

<p class='c021'>“One must have the strength for such a fight,” says Monet, with
the assurance born of experience, when recounting the history of
those troublous days. He is fortunately most generously endowed
with the attributes peculiar to the true artistic temperament—those
exquisite dreams and reveries which are at once a solace, a pleasure,
and a sustaining impetus. Truly was Baudelaire justified in writing:
“Nations have great men in spite of themselves, and so have
families. They do their best not to have any, so that the great man,
in order to exist, must needs possess a power of attack greater than
the force of resistance developed by millions of individuals.”</p>

<p class='c021'>It has long been granted, even by the bitterest of his opponents,
that Monet possesses a few at least of the attributes of genius—the
capacity for turning out large quantities of work, an almost unparalleled
fertility of invention, imagination, and originality, and above
all that priceless gift to the artist—the supreme power of creation.
Moreover, he is ever keen and restless in search of the new and
unexplored, for ever mistrusting the value of his own productions.</p>

</div>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>Never has he been influenced strongly enough to waver in the
pursuit of his ideals, either through the gibes of the critics or the
lack of appreciation on the part of the public.</p>

<p class='c021'>His work is large and simple in character; his colour vigorous
to the utmost capacity of the prismatic tints, bearing the impress of
a passionate, violent, and highly sensitive artistic individuality.</p>

<p class='c021'>Monet is a lyrical poet, singing the joy of life and nature. The
decadence of modern France in literary circles finds no reflection on
his canvas. Strongly opposed by personal temperament to the ugly
and morbid, he allows his brush to touch no subject at all allied to
such themes. In every picture he paints we seem to hear Pippa
singing:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c023'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The year’s at the Spring,</div>

      <div class='line in1'>All’s right with the world!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c025'>A happy serenity is his great charm, and it has been arrived at by
temperament, not by training.</p>

<p class='c013'>At the beginning of the Impressionist movement the nightly
meetings at the Café Guerbois became the centre of a small band of
innovators and iconoclasts, attracted by the sympathy of a common
aim, the necessity of mutual encouragement, and the prescience of
the evolution of a new idea.</p>

<p class='c013'>The first public exhibition of the works of these painters was
held in the spring of 1874 at Nadar’s, in the Boulevard des
Capucines. It created an uproar in the art world, which culminated
in several scenes of personal violence between over-excited critics.
Other exhibitions, chiefly devoted to the works of Claude Monet,
may be roughly summarised as follows: one in 1876; at the
galleries of M. Durand-Ruel in 1877; in 1880 at the offices of
“La Vie Moderne,” Boulevard des Italiens; in 1889 in conjunction
with Rodin at the gallery of M. Georges Petit.</p>

<p class='c013'>Monet exhibited at the Salon for the first time in 1865. The
two marine pieces drew from Edouard Manet the remark, “Who is
this Monet, who looks as if he had taken my name, and happens
thus to profit by the noise I make?” He exhibited for the
last time in 1880. In 1882 he forwarded <i>Glaçons sur la Seine</i>, a
remarkably beautiful conception of an illusory effect, the rejection
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>of which finally ended all relations between the artist and a too
conservative body.</p>

<p class='c013'>With the exception of a semi-private show at Dowdeswell’s of
Bond Street in 1883, Monet made his début in England at the
Winter Exhibition of 1888 of the Royal Society of British Artists,
then under the presidency of Mr. Whistler. That careful critic,
Mr. H. M. Spielman, of the “Magazine of Art,” wrote the
following lines in his journal: “He who contemplates these
distinctive pieces of arch-impressionism, without prejudice, without
‘arrière pensée,’ must own that for strength and brilliancy of general
tone and for decorative effect, they have few, if any, equals.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Monet has never been seen at his best in England; indeed, the
same may be said of all the members of the Impressionist group.
Owing to the ready market for their work in France and America,
it is rarely that the dealers are able to attract across the Channel
any but second-rate canvases. Isolated works have been shown at
the Boussod Vallodon galleries, the New English Art Club, the
International Society’s Exhibition at Knightsbridge, and a miscellaneous
collection on view at the Hanover Gallery, Bond Street, in 1901.
The standard of the latter was not high, and the result disappointing
to all parties. A representative exhibition remains to be held.</p>

<p class='c013'>No other country but France can boast of landscape so varied,
so picturesque, and so atmospherically suited to the Impressionist.
The principal scenes of Monet’s labours have been Havre, Belle-Isle-en-Mer,
the Riviera, La Creuse, La Manche, with Giverny and
the Seine valley in particular. Short visits have been devoted to
England, Norway, and Holland; but the first-named localities have
seen the production of the famous series known under the titles of
<i>Les Meules</i>, <i>Peupliers au bord de l’Epté</i>, <i>Glaçons sur la Seine</i>, <i>Matins
sur la Seine</i>, <i>A Argenteuil</i>, <i>Belle Isle</i>, <i>Bordighera</i>, <i>Antibes</i>, <i>Champs des
Tulipes</i>, and <i>Les Cathédrales.</i> There is also a series of paintings of
the artist’s Japanese water-garden at Giverny, and yet another series
dealing with London under different atmospheric aspects.</p>

<p class='c013'>Claude Monet is enthusiastically in love with London from the
painter’s point of view. From the balconies of the Savoy Hotel
the French master has watched the tidal ebb and flow of the great
grey river, with its squalid southern banks shrouded day by day in
white mist and brown smoke, the warehouses and chimneys coated
in a veil of soot, the legacy of ages. The autumnal fogs, which
harmonise discordant tones, round off harsh outlines, cloak the ugly
and create the beautiful, are to the foreigner London’s greatest
charm, although to the inhabitant they are a deadly infliction.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='small'>LA GRENOUILLÈRE · CLAUDE MONET</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>No writer ever expressed this fascination more eloquently than
the “Wizard of the Butterfly Mark,” who wrote: “And when the
evening mist clothes the riverside world with poetry, as with a veil,
and the poor buildings lose themselves in the dim sky, and the tall
chimneys become campanili, and the warehouses are palaces in the
night, and the whole city hangs in the heavens and fairyland is
before us—then the wayfarer hastens home; the working man and
the cultured one, the wise man and the one of pleasure, cease to
understand, as they have ceased to see; and Nature, who, for once
has sung in tune, sings her exquisite song to the artist alone, her son
and her master—her son in that he loves her, her master in that he
knows her.”</p>

<p class='c013'>With these thoughts Claude Monet is in perfect agreement.
He is amazed at the apathy and indifference of British artists, blinded
no doubt by familiarity, in allowing so fertile a field of labour to
remain comparatively unexplored, not only with regard to the river
scenes, but to the Metropolis as a whole. Whistler was fascinated, so
was Bastien-Lepage, so is Claude Monet; but the Englishman
remains unmoved.</p>

<p class='c013'>A chapter could be written upon the artist possibilities of the
city, and the fringe of the subject would have been then but
touched. Where, asks Monet, can more soul-inspiring subjects for
the brush be found than in the Strand from morning to night, in
the movement of Piccadilly, in the evening colour of Leicester
Square, the classic sweep and brilliancy of Regent Street, the bustle
of the great railway termini, the dignity of Pall Mall and the sylvan
glades of Kensington? They offer themes in such variety that the
devotion of a lifetime would not give adequate realisation.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was during his visit to London with Pissarro and other
painters in 1870 that Monet carried an introduction from Daubigny
which led to his acquaintance with M. Durand-Ruel, expert connoisseur
and most celebrated of all the Parisian art dealers. It
proved to be the commencement of a life-long friendship, and
established business relations which meant the actual necessities of
existence, bread and butter itself, to the struggling Impressionists.
During this visit, which had such auspicious results, Monet
studied with profound admiration the canvases of Turner in the
National Gallery, and he was also able to increase very largely his
knowledge of the art of Japan.</p>

<p class='c013'>In surveying as a whole the work of the last thirty years we can
arrive at but a single conclusion—Claude Monet will rank as one of
the world’s greatest landscapists, the one who, above all others, has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>revealed the transcendent beauty of atmospheric effect in its rarest
moods, in its most varied manifestations, in rocks, skies, trees,
seas, architecture, fogs, snows, even in crowded streets and moving
trains. And Monet is not pre-eminent as a painter of easel-pictures
alone. In the unique decorations of M. Durand-Ruel’s private
apartment, rooms which constitute the most admirable museum of
contemporary painting to be found in France, are realistic paintings
of different forms of still-life, which fully vindicate his supreme
mastership.</p>

<p class='c013'>Little space can be devoted in these pages to an extended notice of
individual canvases, for the output (to use a somewhat commercial
term) of Claude Monet has been exceptionally large. Where the
whole is of such excellence it is difficult to select the masterpiece
upon which can be staked not only the artist’s reputation but the
verdict of the future upon the entire movement.</p>

<p class='c013'>Personally one may say that the Giverny work is the most
triumphant exposition of the methods of Impressionism. If the
series known as <i>Les Cathédrales</i> be added, one may safely challenge
the most critical. It is natural that Giverny should inspire the
finest harvest, for, after years of experimental residence, it is here
that Monet finally settled in 1883. The dominant note in the
Giverny paintings is one of joy in the beauty of life and nature.
They are the works of an inspired genius, who never forgets that
Beauty is the mission of Art.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Les Meules</i> or <i>The Haystacks</i>, exhibited for the first time at the
Durand-Ruel galleries in May 1891, are impressions of a simple
and homely subject—two haystacks in a neighbour’s field, standing
out in relief against the distant hillside. These twenty canvases,
the fruits of a year’s labour, are as novel in conception as unapproachable
in style. The artist watched and painted the haystacks
in the making, followed and noted the atmospheric effects upon
them at every different hour of the day, at every changing season.
He portrays them covered with the pearls of dew, baked by the sun,
lost in the fog, rimed with early frosts, and covered in snow. Each
picture is a masterpiece of beauty, truth and form.</p>

<p class='c013'>The influence of such creations is world-wide. The annual
Salon in Paris demonstrates what a power Monet has become in the
land. Almost to a man the younger painters are Impressionistic,
whilst not a few of the old generation have revised their methods.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='small'>THE BEACH AT ÉTRETAT · CLAUDE MONET</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Soon after <i>Les Meules</i> came <i>Les Peupliers</i>, exhibited in March
1892. The Haystacks were a recital of history during the four
seasons; the Poplars show us their differing aspects under the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>changing atmosphere of a single day. Again the subject is of the
simplest. Seven great Normandy poplars are reflected in the sluggish
waters of a rivulet slowly running through marshy ground.
The continuation of the long column of these graceful trees, ever
diminishing, is lost in the distance, marking the sinuous course of the
stream. The gracefulness of the subject gives it a nobility of effect.
The landscapes are poems.</p>

<p class='c013'>In some of the canvases the master has depicted the dim light of
early morn, through which can be seen nebulous tree-trunks, leaves
and grass, dank and obscure. Upon the water floats a chill blue
mist, broken here and there with the gold rays of the rising sun.</p>

<p class='c013'>In another canvas the mists have cleared away, morning appears
in its superb glory, each dewdrop is a sparkling diamond, each leaf
a shimmering gem. The stream throws out a sheen of gold and
silver, and the whole picture is flooded with a roseate hue.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then comes mid-noon. The blue dome of the unclouded sky is
reflected in a deeper tint across the still water. The trees are dusty,
lifeless, almost colourless. The atmosphere vibrates in an intense
silent heat. Nature is taking her siesta,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c023'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“For now the mid-day quiet holds the hill:</div>
      <div class='line in1'>The grasshopper is silent in the grass;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>The lizard, with his shadow on the stone,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Rests like a shadow, and the winds are dead;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>The purple flower droops: the golden bee</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Is lily-cradled....”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c025'>In the last canvas night is shown falling gently upon the land,
obscuring, with a veil of rich and sombre colour, trees, foliage,
stream. The landscape is lost in sleep.</p>

<p class='c013'>From the photographs, reproduced by the courtesy of M. Claude
Monet, M. Durand-Ruel, M. Paul Chevallier, and M. Georges
Petit, little idea can be gathered of the extreme beauty of the
originals. The colour and technique of Impressionist pictures seem
unfortunately to be insuperable barriers to their reproduction in
monochrome. Upon this account it has been thought inadvisable
to publish reproductions of any of the Haystack or Cathedral series.</p>

<p class='c013'>Monet’s marine pictures are marvellous. In them he depicts
throbbing, swelling, sighing sea, the trickling rills of water that
follow a retreating wave, the glass-like hues of the deep ocean, and
the violet transparencies of the shallow inlets over sand. Monet is
the greatest living painter of water. Witness the <i>Matins sur la
Seine</i>, views painted from the river bank, from the artist’s houseboat,
anchored in mid-stream, and on the various islands of the backwaters
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>between Vétheuil and Vernon. The handling is free, loose, and
masterly. Never has art expressed, through the hands of a craftsman,
anything finer or more virile; never were ideas more frankly
expressed, more freshly and more brilliantly executed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Of the last exhibited group of “effects,” the series known as <i>Les
Cathédrales</i> of Rouen, exhibited at the Durand-Ruel gallery in the
spring of 1895, Monet writes in a personal note to the author: “I
painted them, in great discomfort, looking out of a shop window
opposite the Cathedral. So there is nothing interesting to tell you
except the immense difficulty of the task, which took me three years
to accomplish.” Despite the immense difficulties involved in their
production, Monet considers them to be his finest works. On the
other hand, they are the works least understood by the public.</p>

<p class='c013'>The series consists of twenty-five huge canvases, a feat requiring
considerable physical endurance and indomitable perseverance. Each
canvas demonstrates the fact that the painter possesses eyes marvellously
sensitive to the most subtle modulations of light, and capable
of the acutest analysis of luminous phenomena. The façade of the
ancient Norman fane is depicted rather by the varying atmospheric
effects dissolved in their relative values, than by any actual draughtsmanship
of correct architectural lines. It is very regrettable that
the series was not purchased “en bloc” for the French nation. The
opportunity has been lost. The canvases realised enormous prices,
and are now scattered over two continents.</p>

<p class='c013'>In years to come visitors to Rouen will be shown with pride
the little curiosity shop “Au Caprice” on the south-west side of the
“Place,” from the windows of which Claude Monet evolved these
world-famous paintings of Rouen Cathedral.</p>

<p class='c013'>The attitude of the press and the public in face of this glorious
manifestation of a newly-created art has been, as usual, distinctly and
actively antagonistic. Animosity has been pushed so far as to include
threats of personal violence to the innovator, and of injury to the
offending canvases. It is difficult to believe such stories amidst the
recent pæans of praise and adulation. But the contemporary press
of the period will prove to be a curious study in the hands of some
careful historian of a future age. Readers of the “Figaro,” it may be
mentioned, discontinued their subscriptions and advertisements
because the band of “lunatic visionaries” were so much as mentioned
in its orthodox columns. Dealers required courage in exposing for
sale the “aberrations of disordered imaginations.” History monotonously
repeats itself. A genius generally goes down broken-hearted
to his grave before the world awakes to the value of his creations.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>Paris, “la ville luminaire,” the birthplace of so many revolutions,
both artistic and political, has almost invariably been hostile to any
new spirit in Art. From memory one can cite many instances. In
1833, Parisians assembled that they might jeer and throw mud at
Baryes’s <i>Le Lion</i>, a masterpiece now in the Jardin d’Acclimatation.
Rude’s great bas-relief, <i>Départ des Volontaires de la République</i>, decorating
one of the pillars of the Arc de Triomphe, met with a similar
reception. In 1844, the exquisite paintings of Eugene Delacroix,
now in the Louvre, were greeted with a storm of ridicule. Carpeaux’s
group of sculpture <i>La Danse</i>, ornamenting the façade of the Opera,
was bombarded nightly with ink-pots, and the sculptor was broken-hearted
when compelled to polish the figures of his magnificent
<i>Fontaine des Heures</i> facing the Observatory. Millet and the Barbizon
group had small thanks to return for their reception. The frescoes
of Puvis de Chavannes in the Panthéon, the Sorbonne, and the
Luxembourg had to be guarded against the risk of damage from an
ignorant and exasperated public. The vituperation which assailed
Rodin upon the completion of his statue of Balzac is quite recent,
and cannot be forgotten.</p>

<p class='c013'>Claude Monet has passed through like storms. Edouard Manet
fell a victim to the fury of the attack. His physique was not
strong enough to resist the continual warfare. But Monet is of
stouter calibre, and has lived to see the triumph of his principles,
although he has learnt to value much of the praise, nowadays
lavished upon him, at its true worth.</p>

<p class='c013'>Monet is seen in his most genial moods when, with cigar for
company, he strolls through his “propriété” at Giverny, discussing
the grafting of plants and other agricultural mysteries with his
numerous blue-bloused and sabotted gardeners. He settled with
his family at Giverny in 1883; and Stephen Mallarmé, his old
friend the poet, has given us the address for his letters:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c023'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Monsieur Monet, que l’hiver ni</div>
      <div class='line in3'>L’été sa vision ne leurre,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Habite en peignant, Giverny,</div>
      <div class='line in3'>Sis auprès de Vernon, dans l’Eure.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c025'>He is now sixty-two years of age, in the prime of his powers,
active and dauntless as ever. Each line of his sturdy figure, each
flash from his keen blue eyes, betokens the giant within. He is
one of those men who, through dogged perseverance and strength,
would succeed in any branch of activity. Dressed in a soft khaki
felt hat and jacket, lavender-coloured silk shirt open at the neck,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>drab trousers tapering to the ankles and there secured by big horn
buttons, a short pair of cowhide boots, his appearance is at once
practical and quaint, with a decided sense of smartness pervading
the whole.</p>

<p class='c013'>Monet has the reputation of being surly and reserved with
strangers. If true, this manner must have been assumed to repel
those unwelcome visitors who, out of thoughtless curiosity, invade
his privacy to the waste of valuable time and the gradual irritation
of a most sensitive nature.</p>

<p class='c013'>Determination is the keynote of Monet’s character, as the following
anecdote (told me on the spot by the poet Rollinat) shows. In the
spring of 1892 the artist was busily occupied painting in the neighbourhood
of Fresselines, a wild and picturesque region of precipitous
cliffs and huge boulders in the valleys of the Creuse and Petit Creuse.
A huge oak-tree, standing out in bold relief against the ruddy cliffs, was
occupying Monet’s whole attention. Studies of it were taken at
every possible angle, in every varying atmosphere of the day. Bad
weather intervened, wet and foggy, and operations were suspended
for three weeks. When Monet set up his easel again the tree was
in full bud, and completely metamorphosed. An average painter
would have quitted the spot in disgust. Not so Monet. Without
hesitation he called out the whole village, made the carpenter
foreman, and gave imperative orders that not a single leaf was
to be visible by the same hour on the following morning. The
work was accomplished, and next day Monet was able to continue
work upon his canvases. One admires the painter, and feels sorry
for the unhappy tree.</p>

<p class='c013'>After painting, Monet’s chief recreation is gardening. In his
domain at Giverny, and in his Japanese water-garden across the road
and railway (which to his lasting sorrow cuts his little world in
twain), each season of the year brings its appointed and distinguishing
colour scheme. Nowhere else can be found such a prodigal display
of rare and marvellously beautiful colour effects, arranged from
flowering plants gathered together without regard to expense from
every quarter of the globe.</p>

<p class='c013'>Like the majority of Impressionists, Monet is most pleased with
schemes of yellow and blue, the gold and sapphire of an artist’s
dreams.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>In the neighbouring fields are hundreds of poplars standing in
long regimental lines. These trees, which inspired <i>Les Peupliers</i>,
were bought by Monet to avoid the wholesale destruction which
threatened every tree in the Seine valley a few years ago. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>building authorities of the Paris Exhibition required materials for
palisading, and thousands of trees were ruthlessly felled to make a
cosmopolitan holiday.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the distance are the mills, subjects of the master’s admiration
and reproduction, yearly copied by the scores of students and
amateurs who, year by year, during the summer, journey through
this delightful country.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the peace of Giverny we leave the great painter. He is one
of the few original members of the Impressionist group who has
lived to see the almost complete reversal of the hostile judgment
passed upon his canvases by an ill-educated public. Now he is able
to enjoy not only the satisfaction of having his principles acknowledged,
but also the receipt of the material fruits of a world-wide
renown. Not often do pioneers succeed so thoroughly.</p>

<p class='c013'>Success in the sale-room is not always the same thing as artistic
success, but some information as to the prices Monet now commands
may prove of value. The <i>New York Herald</i>, referring to the well-known
Chocquet auction, says: “It will be observed that the works
by Monet are sought after and purchased at high prices, which are
moreover justified by collectors as well as by dealers.” At the
present moment a small example (about 26 in. by 32 in.) can be had
for any price from four hundred guineas upwards.</p>

<p class='c013'>After the Chocquet sale, dealers of all nationalities flocked
down to Giverny. Two series of impressions, entitled <i>Water
Lilies</i> and <i>Green Bridges</i>, were carried off, and the art public were
deprived of seeing them exhibited as a whole, their creator’s original
intention.</p>

<p class='c013'>The dealers were ready to buy every canvas Monet had in his
studio, even down to the numerous studies he had condemned.
Needless to say that with regard to the latter they were disappointed,
and the destroying fires will still claim their own. In discussing
with the writer this sudden and extraordinary popularity, Monet
remarked: “Yes, my friend, to-day I cannot paint enough, and
make probably fifteen thousand pounds a year; twenty years ago I
was starving.” Only artists can fully appreciate the philosophy of
this short sentence.</p>

<p class='c013'>The principal private collectors of Monet’s work are, in
Paris, M. Durand-Ruel, Count Camondo, M. Faure, M. Dearp,
M. Pellerin, M. Gallimard, and M. Bérard. In Rouen, M. Depeaux.
In the United States, Messrs. C. Lambert Paterson and Potter
Palmer of Chicago, Frank Thompson of Philadelphia, A. A. Pape
of Cleveland, and H. O. Havemeyer of New York. All these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>rich collections of modern art are most generously thrown open to
the inspection and enjoyment of students and lovers of art.</p>

<p class='c013'>Claude Monet is in the possession of undiminished vigour, and
the list of his works will yet receive the names of many fresh
triumphs. A life of strenuous labour, unflagging perseverance in
the pursuit of a high ideal from which he has never flinched, the
production of a long series of magnificent canvases—these great
qualities of true and inspired genius merit and receive our deepest
admiration, our most sincere and genuine homage.</p>

THE artists who accepted originally the title of
Impressionists numbered about fifty in all, and a
complete list of their names can be found in the
catalogues of the eight exhibitions held between
1874 and 1886. There were never more than a
dozen active members. Twenty-six (including
Boudin and Signac) exhibited but once, and ten were represented
in two collections only. Pissarro was the single painter who
contributed to the whole series, Degas and Berthe Morisot
forwarding examples during seven years. Of the remainder, Rouart
and Guillaumin were catalogued in six exhibitions; Caillebotte,
Monet, and Tillot, in five; Cals, Mary Cassatt, Forain, Gauguin,
Renoir, Sisley, and Zandomeneghi, in four. These artists were the
original members of the group until it dispersed about 1886.</p>

<p class='c021'>It will be noted that Camille Pissarro exhibited eight times, and
the fact is characteristic of an artist who was famous for his large
output. On the eve of the publication of this volume comes the sad
intelligence of the death of one of the most gifted members of the
early Impressionist group in France. The loss of Camille Pissarro
is a severe blow to the art he loved so well, and it has formed the
subject of general regret. Born in 1830 at St. Thomas, in the
Antilles, son of a well-to-do trader of Jewish descent, Pissarro at an
early age showed signs of artistic promise. In 1837 his parents
moved to Europe, and his precocious talent was noticed by the
Danish painter Melbye, who took the boy into his atelier as a pupil.
In 1859 Pissarro exhibited for the first time at the Salon, and, by all
accounts, his picture was successfully received. After passing through
several varying phases of artistic evolution the young painter became
an avowed Impressionist. Camille Pissarro’s career can be divided
into no less than four different periods, his temperament being
curiously influenced at times by novel technical ideas.</p>

<p class='c021'>At first he was a victim to Corot’s magic art, and Pissarro worked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>by the side of that master in the woods of Ville d’Avray. The
young painter’s methods were those fashionable amongst such men
as Courbet, Manet, and Sisley. He worked upon immense canvases,
and some of the productions of this period are almost classic in style
and quality of technique. Then he came under the influence of
another great master, Jean-François Millet, whose methods he copied
most faithfully. Following the example of Millet, Pissarro went to
live in the solitude of plains and woods, painting the peasant life
and landscape around him, and gradually gaining a considerable
reputation. He sought to reproduce nature in art in much the
same spirit as Virgil reproduced nature in poetry. His point of view
was more that of an idealist than a realist, and his sympathies were
clearly with the Fontainebleau school. Had there been no Monet
we may feel sure that Pissarro would have ranked in history as one
of the leaders of the Barbizon men.</p>

<p class='c021'>Then blossomed the Impressionist Idea, and Pissarro’s volatile
imagination was fired. The great war of 1870 intervening, Pissarro
fled from the terrors of the invasion, visited London in company with
Monet, and studied on the spot the masterpieces of Turner, Constable,
the Norwich painters, Watts, and the great English portraitists. He
lodged in Lower Norwood, and painted, also with his friend Monet,
in the parks and suburbs of the metropolis, along the riverside, and
in the crowded picturesque streets of the City. Twelve years later,
after much brilliant practice of Impressionism, Pissarro came under
a new influence, the effects of which were but momentary. The
hotly discussed idea known as Pointillism, originated by Seurat and
Signac, attracted Pissarro, and, for a short time, he joined the group
of such restless innovators as Angrand, Maurice Denis, and Van
Rysselberghe.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>During a sketching tour in Normandy in the summer of 1903,
the writer unexpectedly discovered some of the latest work produced
by Pissarro. These pictures had been painted in Havre a few weeks
previously, and had been immediately acquired by the Havre City
Council, and placed on exhibition in the same gallery which contained
the important collection of sketches by Eugene Boudin, as well as a
score of works by other artists of the Impressionist group. Pissarro
had represented the port of Havre as seen from various “coigns de
vantage” offered by neighbouring balconies. The canvases are
charged with life, and are painted with a most unsuspected brilliance
of colour and freshness of tone pitched in the highest possible key,
an effect to be found only in the pure sea-washed sunlit atmosphere
of the morning. In this work of his seventy-third year, the veteran
artist had never arrived at stronger, happier, and more distinguished
results.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>These canvases were extremely different in technique and effect
from the drab landscapes Pissarro painted with such a niggling touch
during that period of his career prior to 1886. The Havre works
prove that he possessed an acute colour sense, and, in conjunction
with his inimitable Parisian street scenes, place him second only to
Manet and Monet in the history of modern French art. It is the
opinion of many connoisseurs that Pissarro’s best work is comprised
in the series of views (painted from elevated points of view) of the
streets, squares, and railway stations, of Paris and Rouen. These
vivid transcripts of modern town life form a remarkable monument
of a long career of high resolve and incessant industry.</p>

<p class='c021'>Like that of Monet and other Impressionist artists, Pissarro’s
work now commands high prices, which are steadily advancing.
Shortly after his death a landscape entitled <i>La Coté Sainte Catherine à
Rouen</i> was sold by public auction for 11,000 francs, an average
present value for his canvases, although not a record figure.</p>

<p class='c021'>With the etching needle Pissarro has done some particularly
interesting work little known in England. Students of this fascinating
medium should look through the Rouen etchings, a masterly
little set.</p>

<p class='c021'>Camille Pissarro was a man of commanding personality, and his
handsome features and long white beard gave him a patriarchal
appearance. Of charming disposition, with a mind of simple
nobility, an excellent raconteur of droll stories chiefly drawn from
his own interesting experiences, he will long be remembered as one
of the most attractive of the great French artists of the nineteenth
century. He lived and worked, as befitted a “paysagist,” in the
midst of a beautiful stretch of country at Eragny, outside Gisors,
not far from Monet’s residence at Giverny. Pissarro left a considerable
amount of work behind, paintings in oil and water-colour,
drawings in every medium, etchings, and lithographs. His art may be
summed up as powerful. It possessed a healthy vitality and sentiment,
and these will assure a lasting respect and admiration for his name.</p>

<p class='c021'>Many of the foregoing remarks apply equally to Pissarro’s close
comrade and friend, Renoir. Auguste Renoir was born in 1841,
and has always taken an important place in the Impressionist movement.
His work forms an epitome of the whole school, and
perhaps it is for that very reason that the artist has not attained a
higher popular appreciation. During his forty years of continual
labour he has produced landscapes, seascapes, large subject compositions,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>studies of still-life, portraits, and exquisite nudes. Critics,
charged with enthusiasm, have found in his canvases the finest
traits of Boucher, Fragonard, Greuze, Reynolds, and Hoppner.</p>

<p class='c021'>Renoir is above all the painter of women and children, and his
creations in this <i>genre</i> glow with the sure fire of genius. He renders
in a marvellous fashion the subtle play of light upon flesh. His
portraits are charming and typically French, graceful in line and
rich in colour, drawn with extraordinary skill, and with great
truth to nature. In the portraits of Bonnat and Duran, writes a
German critic, there are people who have “sat,” but here are
people from whom the painter has had the power of stealing and
holding fast the secret of their being at a moment when they were
not “sitting.” Here are dreamy blond girls gazing out of their
great blue eyes, ethereal fragrant flowers, like lilies leaning against
a rose-bush through which the rays of the setting sun are shining.
Here are coquettish young girls, now laughing, now pouting, now
blythe and gay, and now angry once more, now faltering between
both moods in a charming passion. And there are women of the
world, of consummate elegance, slender and lightly built figures,
with small hands and feet, an even pallor, almond-shaped eyes catching
every light, moist shining lips of a tender grace, bearing witness
to a love of pleasure refined by artifice. And children especially
there are, children of sensitive and flexuous race; some as yet unconscious,
dreamy and free from thought; others already animated,
correct in pose, graceful, and wise. Good examples of this artist as
portraitist are to be found in the pictures <i>Le loge</i>, and <i>On the Terrace</i>,
the latter a most delightful composition.</p>

<p class='c021'>Another famous canvas by Renoir is the <i>Bal au Moulin de la
Galette</i>, a most trying theme in which the master has triumphed
over every difficulty. Degas would have conceived the composition
in a very different spirit, throwing stress upon the sordidness of this
scene from low life, adding a bitterness which is quite foreign to the
temperament of Renoir, whose dominant note is one of sunlight and
noisy dust-enveloped pleasure.</p>

<p class='c021'>Criticising the work of Renoir from a purely technical point of
view one finds throughout almost the whole of his work an unpleasant
tone of Prussian blue, which strikes one at times as spotty and
crude. The handling of the large-sized portrait groups seems often
unnecessarily coarse and repellent. Many find it hard to appreciate
his landscapes, considering them to be thin, of a greasy woolly
texture, unatmospheric and lacking many of the qualities one looks
for in such representations of nature.</p>

</div>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>The work of Auguste Renoir will always remain a battlefield
for the critics. The champions of the group acclaim him as one
of its most brilliant members. Renoir is voluptuous, bright, happy,
and learned without heaviness, says M. Camille Mauclair, adding
that the artist is intoxicated with the beauties of flowers, flesh, and
sunlight.</p>

<p class='c021'>Rare are the artists who distinguish themselves in every branch
of art, lucky the man who excels in one. An example of the latter
is Alfred Sisley, “paysagist” pure and simple, who has left a legacy
of some of the most fascinating landscapes ever painted.</p>

<p class='c021'>Sisley was born in Paris of English parents in 1839, and remained
a citizen of the country of his birth, although he paid several visits
to England. At first he painted conventional landscapes in russet
and grey, after the type of Courbet. After passing under the influence
of Corot he commenced to evolve a style peculiarly his own,
abundantly rich in colour and agreeable in line, loving especially to
paint the violet tints of a sunlit countryside, generally upon canvases
of small and medium size. In his earlier days canvases of enormous
extent alone seemed to satisfy him. He specialised his efforts almost
solely to transcripts from the riverside. When in England he
remained in the neighbourhood of Hampton Court and the Thames
valley generally; in France he painted on the edge of the Seine, or
the Loing, finally settling at Moret, where he died in 1899. He
was less successful in draughtsmanship than in colour, particularly
when he attempted to achieve with Moret church what Monet had
done with Rouen cathedral.</p>

<p class='c021'>In spite of the production of many little masterpieces, Sisley
lived to the day of his death on the verge of poverty. Never a
popular artist, although he and his wife led a life of the most frugal
description, he was for ever uncertain of finding the barest means of
subsistence. This embittered his existence, and undoubtedly tended
to cut short a life of much activity and talent. “Sisley, be it said,
worked always, struggled long, and suffered much. But he was
brave and strong, a man of will, consecrated to his art, and determined
to go forward on the road he had taken, wherever it might
lead. He faced bad fortune with a front of undaunted energy. His
years of <i>début</i> were cruel times. His pictures sold seldom and
poorly. He kept on, however, with the same brave heart, with that
joyous fervour which shines from all his works.” These words were
spoken by an old friend at the graveside of Sisley. M. Tavernier
went on to remark that the success which arrived for several of the
other Impressionists was slower in coming to Sisley. “This never
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>for a moment disturbed him; no approach to a feeling of jealousy
swept the heart of this honest man, nor darkened this uplifted spirit.
He only rejoiced in the favour which had fallen upon some of his
group, saying with a smile, ‘They are beginning to give us our due:
my turn will come after that of my friends.’... Sisley is gone too
soon, and just at the moment when, in reparation for long injustice,
full homage is about to be rendered those strong and charming
qualities which make him a painter exquisite and original among
them all, a magician of light, a poet of the heavens, of the waters,
of the trees—in a word, one of the most remarkable landscapists of
this day.”</p>

<p class='c021'>A contemporary of Sisley, equally gifted and more fortunate
financially, is Armand Guillaumin, whose art is practically unknown
in England. His style and his subjects are of the simplest, whilst
his colour is vigorous, pure, and rich in tone. Possessing few tastes
outside his art his life has been one of continued and active devotion
to its perfection. Son of a linendraper, like Corot, his youth was
passed behind the counter, and later as a clerk in an office. In the
meanwhile he attended, when possible, the “Académie Suisse,” by
the Quai des Orfèvres, a curious school without professors. Here
he worked in company with Pissarro and Cézanne. This, combined
with study in the public galleries and sketching along the riverside
and in the streets and parks of Paris, constituted his sole education.</p>

<p class='c021'>In a letter to the writer, Guillaumin says that Courbet,
Daubigny, and Monet are the masters who have influenced his
style most, with perhaps special stress upon the methods of Monet.</p>

<p class='c021'>Some years ago a lucky speculation in a lottery attached to the
Crédit Foncier brought the artist a “gros lot” of about £4000,
which immediately freed him from further anxieties about money,
and gave him complete liberty to exercise the art he lives for. He
contributed to the original exhibition held by the Impressionists in
1874, where his pictures, views of Charenton, at once marked
him as a painter of special talent and originality. In 1894, at the
Durand-Ruel galleries, were exhibited about one hundred of his
canvases executed in various mediums, and the effect of this collection
upon students has been remarkable. These pictures were
painted for the most part at Agay, Damiette, and Crozant. In the
solitude of these deep valleys, overhung by cliffs down which rush
the limpid Creuse and Sédelle from the mountains of the Cevenne
to the sea, works the artist in hermit-like solitude, two hundred
miles from Paris and far from railways and latter-day civilisation.</p>

<p class='c021'>Guillaumin is an incredibly prolific worker, and this, although
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>often a sign of great talent, is much deplored by his admirers, who
cannot help believing that he is wasting in the production of countless
sketches and repetitions a talent which is strong enough to
create masterpieces. Zola’s reproach addressed to Gustave Doré
comes to the mind when speaking of Guillaumin. Such an artist
is likely to combine with business men in manufacturing works
purely commercial. There is yet time for Guillaumin to produce
some great masterpiece with which to crown the glory of his long
career.</p>

<p class='c021'>Other manifestations from the parent stem of Impressionism took
the form of Idealism with André Mellino at its head; the Salon of
the Rose + Croix, with Sar Peladan in command; and the “Intimists,”
a body consisting of Charles Cottet, Simon Bussy, and Henri
Le Sidaner, who is referred to elsewhere. The Salon of the Rose +
Croix, held in the early nineties, was one of the most eccentric art
societies of the past century, a mixture of art, religion, politics,
and rules of morality. Its members were forbidden to exhibit
historical, prosaic, patriotic, and military subjects, portraits, representations
of modern life, all rustic scenes and landscapes (except
those in the style of Poussin), seamen and seascapes, comic subjects,
oriental subjects, pictures of domestic animals, and studies of still-life.
The doings of Sar Peladan and his followers have long since been
forgotten, but at the time they afforded a curious study in artistic
eccentricity.</p>

<p class='c021'>There are several other men who have rendered good service to
Impressionism, although one is not able to mention more than their
names in this chapter. Paul Gauguin, an artist of decided ability,
whose death has only just been chronicled, contributed to several of
the exhibitions in the Durand-Ruel and other galleries. At first a
simple painter of Breton landscapes he inclined towards “Pointillism.”
Upon his return from a long visit to Tahiti his manner became crude
and bizarre to an extreme, not altogether admirable, although leaving
an impression of uncommon strength. Gauguin was a friend of Van
Gogh whom, together with Renoir and Cézanne, he may be said to
have influenced. Another of his pupils is Emile Bernard, the symbolist.</p>

<p class='c021'>Vincent Van Gogh requires mention as a painter who practised
the methods of Impressionism to their extreme limit. A Dutchman
who lived in France, Van Gogh, a man of great talent, committed
suicide after a most unhappy life. Like his own personality, these
canvases are exotic, though at times displaying a more tender note.
Had fortune been less unkind he would have developed into a great
artist, for nature had endowed him with a rich genius.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>In the eighth exhibition organised by the Société des artistes
Indépendants were some ambitious works, interesting but totally
unconvincing, painted in the new and then hotly discussed “Pointillist”
style. Seurat, Signac, Ibels, Maurice Denis, Henri-Edmond
Cross, Théo Van Rysselberghe, and Angrand, were members of this
movement initiated by Seurat and Signac. George Seurat died at an
early age in 1890, and this was doubtless the chief reason for the
collapse of the group. The aim of the “Pointillists” was to resolve
the colours of nature back into six bands of the spectrum, and to
represent these on the canvas by spots of unmixed pigment. At a
sufficient distance these spots combine their hues upon the retina,
giving the effect of a mixture of coloured lights rather than pigments,
resulting in an increase instead of a loss of luminosity. One of the
first converts was the veteran Camille Pissarro, who happily abandoned
these extraordinary methods which Théo Van Rysselberghe and a few
others continue to employ.</p>

EUGÈNE Carrière is one of those great artists so
prolific in France who alone would make the fame of
any ordinary country. For his work the writer has
always had deep sympathy, and this feeling has
strengthened since the days when he copied the
works of the master now in the Luxembourg. There
can be no better method of studying any artist, and specially is it
needed in the case of such a painter as Carrière. It is only during
the long patient hours spent in trying to reproduce in facsimile these
strange elusive pictures that one can grasp their technical qualities,
their poetic intention, their thoughtful nature, and can fully recognise
the fine achievement of the artist. As the copyist stands and works
for hours, thinking, reasoning, reproducing, the whole history of the
man and his art slowly reveals itself.</p>

<p class='c021'>It has been said of Carrière that he has “le génie de l’œil,” and
it is exactly this “genius of the eye” which constitutes the bond of
sympathy between all Impressionists. There exists between Carrière,
Pointelin, and Whistler, the greatest similitude. Their outlook
upon nature is identical, and their method of expression most
characteristic. They have found their chief inspiration in rendering
misty veiled effects, sometimes the result of natural means, haze,
moonlight, river mist, early sunrise; sometimes purposely arranged
by means of darkened interiors, and the skilful control and exclusion
of strong lights. In each case the result sought after is the same.</p>

<p class='c021'>Carrière possesses, in almost the highest possible degree, the
power of visualisation (one is nearly writing the power of second
sight) which Claude Monet also has, though in a different degree.
The first has caught in an entrancing style the infinitely varied
degrees of luminous light in the evening twilight. He has painted
the shadows of shades. The second, in an equally fascinating
manner, has rendered the shadows of sunlight. In the works of
both artists all exact contours are lost; in Carrière by reason of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>the semi-obscurity of night, in Monet because of the blinding
equalising glare of noon-day sun. The one is as apparently colourless
as the other is apparently exaggerated. Yet both are right,
true to nature and to their own individual temperaments, in fact
true Impressionists.</p>

<p class='c021'>As a portraitist Eugène Carrière has no rival at the present
moment. His marvellous powers of vision have placed him in
a position unassailable. The ordinary portraitist, the painter
“à la mode” (probably “à la mode” for this very reason), depicts
the superficial aspect of his sitter, together with a photographic
delineation of the features. Whilst the onlooker wonders at the
dexterous skill, the clever schooling and frequent harmonies of
colour, he generally passes on unmoved. With Carrière the effect
is different; one cannot easily leave such triumphs. On the contrary,
we stay to admire, not the technical gymnastics of the artist, but
the subtle superhuman manner in which the soul of the sitter has
been transferred to the canvas by the brush of a man of rare genius.</p>

<p class='c021'>His lithographs too are marvellous. Should any reader carp at the
use of such word let him carefully examine the portrait-studies of
Anatole France, Rodin, Verlaine, Daudet, Geffroy, Madame
Carrière, and the artist himself, also the <i>Christ at the Tomb</i>, the
<i>Théâtre de Belleville</i>, <i>Maternité</i>, and many others. The more these
great works are studied the more real they become. Daudet lives
again in a drawing recreating the great novelist in a peaceful atmosphere
of dreams which seems to remain the peculiar secret of the
artist. Eugène Carrière becomes a clairvoyant when he commences
a portrait.</p>

<p class='c021'>His paintings of the intimate life of the family, the circle round
the fireside or the little gatherings in the common room during a
winter evening, have a quiet charm which his contemporaries rarely
attain. Such groups, it may be said, find little favour from those
who issue commissions for family heirlooms, and Carrière has no
chance of becoming a fashionable painter of human mediocrity.
One remembers though that Mr. Sargent has proved recently that
even with mediocrity a genius can do a great deal. Carrière, however,
is never likely to wish to rival Bonnat or Carolus-Duran. His
scenes are not so much represented as suggested. His drawing is a
reproduction of the play of light upon the different planes of the
subject, the whole picture becoming a symphonic development of
light. His brush manipulates colour much as a sculptor manipulates
clay, and the results are real Impressions.</p>

<p class='c021'>Eugène Carrière has been inspired by no particular school, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>has no special theories to regulate his methods. Yet, in spite of
himself, a group, animated by his ideals, has gathered and formulated
rules. This group and its system will have but a short duration, for
an art so personal and distinguished as is that of Carrière cannot
in any possible way be transmitted to pupils or followers. Carrière
occupies in painting much the same position as his friend Rodin
occupies in sculpture. Such art is not to be copied, much as it may
be admired. If there could be any analogy in literature one would
cite Edgar Allan Poe. The poet of the shadows has had an
enormous influence upon French art and literature, and Carrière
has undoubtedly come under his strange spell.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='small'>MOTHERHOOD · EUGÈNE CARRIÈRE</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Much has been written concerning the exhibited works of this
artist, and a bibliography would contain the names of the most celebrated
art critics in Paris. The universal opinion is that in Carrière
France possesses an artist of exceptional endowments. His gift is
a peculiar one, which has not appeared before in exactly the same
manner, and, within his own limitations, the painter’s equal will
probably never be seen again. A well-known writer upon art subjects
has penned an appreciation which conveys a clear insight into the
methods of the master. Carrière, he says, is not an inductive painter,
he does not construct his whole from parts. He does not work on,
wisely, cautiously, from the forehead to the eyes, continuing by way
of the cheekbones. In the manner of a sculptor, he builds up his
picture as a complete whole, he balances his masses, he constructs.
Insensibly the face lights up on the background, the successive veils
which enveloped it are torn away and hide his thoughts no longer.
This simultaneous process never leaves him quite satisfied, and he
constantly reviews his original plans. He lives for the creation to
which he gives life. His work is an effort, an attempt, the result of
a mysterious genius whose secret is never all told. What he knows
before is the impression he expects to obtain, what it will tell, what
it will reveal of the character and will express of the invisible
reality. And it is thus he approaches those faces which speak to us
of an intense inner life. His plans settled, he paints astonishing
faces, mobile and quivering as they smile and speak.</p>

<p class='c021'>A few personal particulars may be added. Eugène Carrière
passed his life up to the age of eighteen in Strasbourg, and displayed
no special inclination toward the artistic career. But a visit to some
galleries awoke the latent fire, and his ambitions were roused. He
then entered the atelier of Cabanel. During the war he was captured
by the Germans, and sent as prisoner to Dresden, where he
studied with diligence in the museums. Upon his return to France
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>in 1872 he worked for five years at the École des Beaux-Arts (he
had been there for a short time before the war) and then, none too
well equipped for the battle, set up in his own studio. He attempted
to gain the Prix de Rome, but failed. Shortly after followed his
marriage, together with a semi-retreat to the Vaugirard, where he
toiled for five years, turning his family to artistic account as models.
These days of unremitting labour proved to be the foundations of
his fame, for, when he returned to Paris, he reaped almost immediately
the fruits of success and appreciation. As we write, the news comes
that the authorities of the Luxembourg have purchased Carrière’s
<i>Dead Christ</i> for £1000.</p>

<p class='c021'>Auguste Pointelin is a passionate Impressionist in the best sense of
the word. He paints in low tones (almost monotones) the twilight,
moonrise, the sombre and melancholy notes in Nature. He is the
poet-painter of those evening hours when—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c023'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The sun is set; the swallows are asleep;</div>
      <div class='line'>The bats are flitting fast in the grey air;</div>

      <div class='line'>And evening’s breath, wandering here and there</div>
      <div class='line'>Over the quivering surface of the stream,</div>
      <div class='line'>Wakes not one ripple from its summer dream.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c024'>The artist’s character can be read at a glance from these canvases.
We see at once that he is a strong man, of nervous and romantic
temperament, somewhat a pessimist, perhaps a writer of verse, probably
a fine musician, fond of solitude and reverie, yet of good heart
and noble mind.</p>
<p class='c013'>Monet is of the lowlands. He worships the plains and paints
the sun hot and keen, and all that it reveals. He revels in depicting
great trees, the lustrous brilliancy of corn and poppies, the bubble
and iridescence of quick-flowing trout-streams, the flash of white
cliffs, the luminous shadows of haycocks, every varying phase of
the play of brilliant light upon the face of responsive nature.
Pointelin is a man of the hills, delighting to work amidst deep
wooded glens or lonely tracks of mountain scenery, trying to reproduce
the glints of moonlight upon black bottomless pools. He
loves to depict the tranquillity of the long silent valleys, through
which roll heavy mists, whilst the rising sun tints with a rosy glow
the tips of the neighbouring peaks. Our admiration of Monet does
not blind us to the beauty of Pointelin. In a sense the two artists
are complementary to each other. The art of Pointelin may be
compared to a “Reverie” by Schumann, that of Monet to a
“Rhapsody” by Brahms.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>Auguste Emmanuel Pointelin was born at Arbois, June 23, 1839,
and the first art teaching he received was from the hands of
M. Victor Maire. Success was long in coming, and for a livelihood
he had to turn to several other professions, the chief being that of a
mathematical professor.</p>

<p class='c013'>Pointelin has received the usual honours France awards to her
most distinguished citizens. He has been decorated with the
Legion of Honour, is “Hors Concours” at the Salon, and received
(amongst many other like trophies) the Gold Medals at the Exhibitions
of 1889 and 1900. His work is to be found in many of the
public galleries of the country, including the Luxembourg. The
note of his art is a certain refinement and aloofness which is rarely
found in contemporary Salons. Of him it may be said: “Through
his brain, as through the last alembic, is distilled the refined essence
of that thought which began with the gods, and which they left
him to carry out.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Some time ago the writer was painting by the edge of the
Seine in company with Maxime Maufra, and the artist recounted
the origins of his Impressionist tendencies. “I am directly influenced
by Turner and Constable,” he said. “I admired and studied their
works whenever it was possible during the time I spent as a
commercial man in Liverpool twenty years ago. There is no doubt
that Monet, Pissarro, and the others of that group, owe the greater
part of their art to the genius of the great Englishmen, just as
Delacroix and Manet were indebted in a previous generation.”</p>

<p class='c013'>This testimony is interesting, as it comes from one of the leaders
of the modern school of “La peinture claire,” the school of light,
of life, and of movement. It is valuable in view of the fact that
some of the artists who have profited most by the valuable example
of our men of genius seem least inclined to acknowledge their debt.
For instance, Pissarro writes: “I have read with great interest your
article. I do not think, as you say, that the Impressionists are
connected with the English school, for many reasons too long to
develop here. It is true that Turner and Constable have been
useful to us, as all painters of great talent have; but the base of our
art is evidently of French tradition, our masters are Clouet, Nicolas
Poussin, Claude Lorrain, the eighteenth century with Chardin, and
1830 with Corot.” This statement is somewhat at variance with
facts as we know them, and does not agree with several letters from
Pissarro in the writer’s possession previously quoted.</p>

<p class='c013'>To attempt to record bright open-air effects, to struggle with all
the thousand nuances of the atmosphere, the division of tones, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>juxtaposition of colour, the general principles and technical practice
adopted by the Impressionists, is to come under a ban. There is
an old and well-beloved professor at the Beaux-Arts who taught the
writer, a member of the Institute and Officer of the Legion of
Honour, a man of much official influence, who, in a single phrase,
has summed up the feeling of a large body in France with reference
to the Impressionists. “They are a disgrace to French art,” he said
bitterly. Such an irreconcilable attitude has compelled a section of
the younger artists in France to adopt a style altogether opposite to
that discussed in these pages, a reactionary manner in many cases
opposed to their natural temperaments. They seek in Nature for the
slightest cause which will give them reason for the use of black paint,
forgetting that in a world charged with sun and iridescence the
only absolute black that can be found is in the heart of a bean
blossom, which is black only by the exclusion of the atmosphere.
The slightest shadow they paint black, any dark piece of clothing is
rendered in black. They have evolved a lugubrious funereal style
and choice of subject which is sad, dull, inartistic, dyspeptic. This
section of the art community has been named the “Nubians.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Maxime Maufra is an adversary fighting this group of reactionaries,
and perhaps his successful example may bring some of
these erring ones back to the fold. He has the courage to paint in a
light key, because he sees all nature in such a value, and by following
the dictates of his artistic temperament he has become the exponent
of a beautiful and personal art. He does not aspire to the position
of a little Monet, but attempts to carry the master’s methods forward.
Maufra maintains that Monet has by no means said the last word
in Impressionism. Maufra and his friends are not content with the
first illuminated corner presented by Nature, which, save for the
sense of illumination, is probably uninteresting and ill-composed.
They are equally attracted by beautiful rhythmic line, balance of
form, by composition as well as by colour. The ethereal tints in
nature which the pioneers were happy to reproduce, does not satisfy
the younger men now that the fundamental laws of the Impressionists
have been agreed upon.</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>Born at Nantes in 1861, the only regular art education Maxime
Maufra received was from M. Le Roux, a local professor. His
father, a man of business, decided that the son should follow the
same vocation, much to the son’s disgust. After a few years of
preliminary training Maufra was sent to Liverpool in order that he
might acquire the language and further the commercial interests of
his father’s house. Maufra studied English, more or less, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>practised art, copying in the museums and private collections, and
sketching in the neighbourhoods of New Brighton, Seacombe, and
amongst the docks and shipping of the great port. Business was
not neglected, but having effected a lucky “deal” which placed him
in the possession of a little capital, he cut the cable which joined his
life to commerce and sailed into the open sea of art. His family
protested, his friends implored him not to take such a rash step.
Maxime Maufra became a professional artist. For five years he
toiled with his brush, working hard at every different method of
technical expression, trying oils, water-colours, and the etching needle.
Dealers did not come forward, buyers were never seen. At last, at
the very end of his financial resources, he organised a tiny “one-man”
show in Paris.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the “Echo de Paris” M. Octave Mirbeau published a short
criticism, which voiced the general opinion of Maufra’s talent.
“Yesterday,” writes Mirbeau, “I entered the galleries of de
Boutheville, where are exhibited about sixty works by Maufra.
I was immediately conquered, for I found myself in the presence
of an artist in full control of himself, who, after the necessary
indecisions, the usual educational troubles, has realised that style is
the most important thing—in fact, the joy of art.”</p>

<p class='c013'>A few of the paintings were sold, enough to cover the expenses
of the exhibition. A better luck awaited Maufra. M. Durand-Ruel
casually glanced into the rooms before the close of the
modest collection. He asked to see the artist. Maufra was in
Brittany, and a telegram called him back to Paris. An interview
followed in the Rue Lafitte between artist and dealer, and never
since that day has Maufra known the anxieties of living on hope,
for M. Durand-Ruel, with characteristic acumen, had arranged for
his future.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the spring of 1901, at the galleries of M. Durand-Ruel,
Maxime Maufra organised his last and most successful exhibition,
about fifty canvases executed in various mediums being shown.
From the admirable preface written by M. Arsène Alexandre, one
of the most perspicacious of French critics, the following lines
may be quoted: “Maufra continues in the school of the Impressionists
in this manner, that the <i>point de départ</i> in each of his
pictures is in reality a quick and profound impression. He detaches
himself from the school inasmuch as the realisation is a calculated
and skilful art; and this is complete Impressionism.” A final quotation
from the pen of M. Gabriel Mourey in “Le Grand Journal”
aptly sums up the talent of this artist: “One could accuse Maufra
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>at the time of his first exhibition at the de Boutheville galleries of
submitting himself to the influence of Claude Monet. Already,
however, he reveals his strong personality. Here he is to-day a free
man and master of himself, capable of realising whatever his thoughts
impel him to. He has his own conception of Nature, and he
realises it with a liberty and independence which is veritably
masterful. The diversity of his talent is proved in the most striking
fashion. Scotland, Brittany, Normandy are evoked with an extraordinary
facility, the different characteristics of these three countrysides,
their special conditions, their peculiar atmosphere. They are
like portraits in which a soul breathes, in which the blood runs
beneath the skin, where the mystery of being is declared. The
words of Flaubert’s St. Anthony come involuntarily to the lips
before these pictures of Nature, sometimes savage, sometimes in a
more tender mood: ‘There are some spots on earth so beautiful
that one wishes to press Nature against one’s heart.’”</p>

JEAN FRANÇOIS RAFFAËLLI joined the Impressionist
movement late, and did not commence to
exhibit with the other members of the group until
1880, when he sent a canvas to the gallery in the
Rue des Pyramides. He had clearly grasped the
trend and scope of the idea, but cannot be classed
altogether with the other members of the group as a “Luminarist.”
This may be due to many causes apparent in his work. He is not
a painter for the love of painting itself, and does not revel in colour
for colour’s sake. He is no analyst of the shimmering effects of a
summer’s sun. That side of Impressionism has never appealed to
him. Yet his right to be numbered amongst them is assured, for, in
spirit, he is one of the first of the school.</p>

<p class='c021'>Raffaëlli is the historian of the “banlieue” of Paris. His street
scenes are typical, life-like, and modern, and they will be treasured
in future years as veritable documents of the daily existence of the
great city. He wanders through the dreary “no man’s land” outside
the fortifications, and transfers to his block the most vivid portraits of
the nondescript characters who swarm through that gaunt wilderness.
He is a man of much mental refinement, who has had to struggle
for every inch of the artistic success which now surrounds him.
Richly endowed by nature, he had no resources to fall back upon
save his determination to conquer. In a few words M. Geffroy
sums up the opening of this curious career.</p>

<p class='c021'>Raffaëlli has had many employments, has been engaged in many
trades, has searched the town for work. He has been in an office,
has sung bass at the Théâtre Lyrique, has chanted psalms in a church
choir, and at the same time painted under the tuition of Gérôme at
the École des Beaux-Arts. He travelled through Europe, penetrating
even so far as Algeria, working in each town as he stopped.
Returning to Paris he exhibited landscapes founded upon the studies
he had accumulated in his portfolio, some pictures of the Louis XIII.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>style, some portraits, a view of the Opera. Suddenly he opened his
eyes to a sight nobody had seen before, disdained by the whole
world, subjects which had never reached the dignity of an entrance
in art circles. He became the recorder of the suburbs of Paris and
their wandering inhabitants.</p>

<p class='c021'>For years he experimented endeavouring to produce a medium
best suited to his temperament. In the solid paint crayons we have
an addition to the working tools of the artist which is of notable
importance. This is not his only gift to France, for it is he who
practically resuscitated the beautiful but dying art of etching in
colours. In this work he was ably seconded by Miss Mary Cassatt.
He is not only an artist but an actor, a musician, an orator, a
sculptor, an etcher, a pastellist, an illustrator, and a man of letters.
He is a fine example of the pioneer temperament. No sooner is
success achieved in one branch of energy than he is in chase of
another idea. One day he is trying to invent a perfect oil-crayon;
the next, and colour etching is his sole ambition. He draws the
elegant “mondaine” of the Boulevards, and then sallies out to study
the frowsy denizens of the “banlieue.” In this quarter he found
congenial subjects for a series of little masterpieces.</p>

<p class='c021'>Amidst these wretched surroundings, warehouses, factories, wooden
sheds ruinous and dilapidated, refuse heaps, brick-kilns, homes of the
outcasts and cut-throats of the metropolis, Raffaëlli discovered a rich
mine of material hitherto entirely unworked. The district is peculiar
to Paris, and owes its existence to the clear half-mile of view required
around the useless fortifications. This territory has, in mining phrase,
been “jumped” by the penniless. Upon it squat the failures, the
drunkards, the thieves, all the vicious under-life of the city. The
artist revealed this world to the unsuspecting citizens. He lived in
it, studied it day by day, and is a greater authority than the “sergots”
upon the manners and customs of a neighbourhood which even the
police shun. Such a blot upon the fair page of so magnificent a
capital is rapidly being wiped away, but Raffaëlli has immortalised
in his etchings and drawings some of the poetic atmosphere which
enveloped these legions of the damned.</p>

</div>

<p class='c021'>During the course of a long and strenuous career, Raffaëlli has
received many decorations. He is of the Legion of Honour, besides
having received numerous medals and awards from foreign exhibitions.
He is represented adequately in the Luxembourg, and
many continental galleries. He enjoys the admiration and friendship
of a host of connoisseurs throughout the world. His studio
is most pleasant. Facing the broad green sweeps of the boulevard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>by the fortifications, in the Rue de Courcelles, it occupies a large
area on the ground floor, having been built over a spacious courtyard
surrounded by banks of foliage and flowers. The predominant
note is that of cheerfulness. The decoration is bright and restful,
the ruling colours being delicate shades of yellow and blue. The
usual theatrical adornments of a French studio are absent; there
are no oriental carpets and rugs, no armour, no antique furniture, so
dear to the heart of the Gallic painter. In this atelier the master
holds periodical conferences, exhibitions, and friendly gatherings.
Upon these occasions one will meet the cleverest men in Paris,
for Raffaëlli is a celebrated conversationalist as well as a famous
artist.</p>

<p class='c021'>Degas has a temperament strangely different from that of Raffaëlli,
and, although always classed with the Impressionists, he stands
apart from the recognised group. He has never endeavoured to
transmit the impression of atmosphere, and work “en plein air”
does not attract him. He has, however, profited much by the
teaching of the Impressionists, particularly in relation to the use of
radiant colour, for at one time he painted in greys which were
closely allied to black. He exhibited continually with the other
men in the early days of the movement, and proved a genius both in
suggestion and organisation.</p>

<p class='c021'>Hilaire Germain Edgard Degas was born in Paris, July 19, 1834.
He entered the École des Beaux-Arts in 1855, studying under
Lamothe and also having Ingres for a master. He made his first
appearance at the Salon of 1865 with a pastel entitled <i>War in the
Middle Ages</i>. In 1866 he contributed the <i>Steeplechase</i>, the first of
his series devoted to scenes of modern life. In 1867 he exhibited
<i>Family Portraits</i>, in 1868 the portrait of a ballet-dancer, and during
1869 and 1870 some further portraits which closed his connection
with official art, for he never sent contributions to the Salon again.
In his early work he did not confine his brush to subjects of daily
actuality, such compositions as <i>Semiramis Building the Walls of Babylon</i>
and <i>Spartan Youths Wrestling</i> being far removed both in style and <i>genre</i>
from later work. During the sixties his canvases were classical in
spirit as well as in subject. He had a strong feeling for the
Primitives together with Fra Angelico, and much of his work
conveyed a reminiscence of Holbein. A Realist from the beginning,
the <i>Interior of an American Cotton-Broker’s Office</i>, painted in 1860, shows
that his temperament has never radically changed. This canvas, now
in the museum at Pau, is minutely exact in all its details. It is
Realism but emotionless, without atmosphere and lacking all feeling.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>It shows too that forty-three years ago the artist was acquiring that
facility of hand which has placed him at the head of modern
draughtsmen.</p>

<p class='c021'>Degas exhibited in company with Manet, Monet, and the
Impressionists generally, at five exhibitions, namely 1874, 1876, 1878,
1879 and 1880. In the last-named year he exhibited a series of
portraits of criminals, and commenced to model figures of dancers in
wax. In December 1884 he showed some racecourse scenes, and
at the last exhibition of the Impressionists in 1886 exhibited studies
of the nude, jockeys, washerwomen, and other characters of modern
life. He has worked with the etcher’s needle, and also in lithography,
his subjects being generally confined to theatrical life and
incidents noticeable on the Parisian boulevards.</p>

<p class='c021'>The characteristic of Degas personally is mystery. He now
refuses to exhibit his works, he shuts his door to all visitors. Like
most artists he detests writers, and there is a legend that he successfully
grappled with one enterprising but unwelcome interviewer and
dropped the unfortunate critic down a flight of stairs. This proves
how thoroughly his principles are carried out in practice. “I think
that literature has only done harm to art,” he said once to George
Moore. “You puff out the artist with vanity, you inculcate the
taste for notoriety, and that is all; you do not advance public taste
by one jot. Notwithstanding all your scribbling it never was in a
worse state than it is at present. You do not even help us to sell
our pictures. A man buys a picture, not because he read an article
in a newspaper, but because a friend, who he thinks knows something
about pictures, told him it would be worth twice as much ten years
hence as it is worth to-day.”</p>

<p class='c021'>With these strong views one can understand the attitude of
Degas to the art world in general. It was a very different attitude
from that of Manet who gloried in the fight. “Do you remember,”
Degas said once to George Moore (who quotes the conversation in
his “Impressions and Opinions”), “how Manet used to turn on me
when I wouldn’t send my pictures to the Salon? He would say,
‘You, Degas, you are above the level of the sea, but for my part, if
I get into an omnibus and some one doesn’t say, “M. Manet, how
are you, where are you going?” I am disappointed, for I know
then that I am not famous.’” This conversation reveals in a curious
manner the differing characters of the two men; Manet with that
attractive vanity so often to be found in the artistic temperament,
Degas, a satiric misanthrope analysing the degraded types which
make up the gay life of Paris.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='small'>DANCING GIRL FASTENING HER SHOE · EDGAR DEGAS</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>The work of Degas may be sorted into four main groups—the
racing series, the theatrical studies, the drawings of the nude, and
a few landscapes. From many points of view the scenes of the
<i>coulisses</i> come first. Superb in draughtsmanship, they represent the
life of the theatre in a way it has never been represented before.
In one we see shivering girls rehearsing upon a cold cheerless stage
lit by a few gas jets; in another the <i>première danseuse</i> quivering
upon tiptoe amidst the frenzied plaudits of an excited audience.
Degas reproduces the atmosphere with a marvellous precision, which
only those engaged in the busy turmoil behind the curtain can
fully judge. Upon these <i>scènes de théâtre</i> will rest his fame, for
humankind is never likely to tire of such vivid renderings of a life
always fascinating to the outside world.</p>

<p class='c021'>Degas is not a countryman, and cannot be classed amongst
sportsmen, or lovers of horseflesh. His jockeys and racehorses are
highly extolled, but with animals he has not always succeeded. It
is not sufficient to be a great artist in order to convey convincing
impressions of sporting scenes. An artist must have the whole
spirit of sport thoroughly engrained in his nature before he can
properly represent it. Apart from the city, Degas is out of his
element, and this is very apparent in the landscapes he has painted
during the last eight years. The glamour of the fields and hedges
does not touch his soul. Rural life he finds dull, and naturally his
essays in landscape painting are somewhat painful. He has not the
temperament which can faithfully interpret the poetry of the countryside,
and is more at home in the purlieus of the opera or upon the
asphalte of the boulevards.</p>

<p class='c021'>Degas is a realist, and his subjects are for the most part
exceedingly trivial in selection. After racehorses and ballet-dancers,
he loves to depict buxom ladies of the lower classes engaged in
personal ablution. It is extraordinary that the pupil of Ingres, the
painter of <i>La source</i>, should create such appalling creatures. The
most plausible apology comes from Mr. George Moore. The nude,
he writes, has become well-nigh incapable of artistic treatment.
Even the more naïve are beginning to see that the well-known nymph
exhibiting her beauty by the borders of a stream can be endured no
longer. Let the artist strive as he will, he will not escape the
conventional; he is running an impossible race. Broad harmonies of
colour are hardly to be thought of; the gracious mystery of human
emotion is out of all question—he must rely on whatever measure of
elegant drawing he can include in his delineation of arms, neck, and
thigh; and who in sheer beauty has a new word to say? Since
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>Gainsborough and Ingres, all have failed to infuse new life into the
worn-out theme. But cynicism was the great means of eloquence of
the Middle Ages; and with cynicism Degas has again rendered the
nude an artistic possibility. The critic then describes these works in
most sympathetic phrases. Three coarse women, middle-aged and
deformed by toil, are perhaps the most wonderful. One sponges
herself in a tin bath; another passes a rough nightdress over her
lumpy shoulders, and the touching ugliness of this poor human
creature goes straight to the heart. Then follows a long series
conceived in the same spirit. “Hitherto,” says Degas, “the nude
has always been represented in poses which presuppose an audience,
but these women of mine are honest, simple folk, unconcerned by
any other interests than those involved in their physical condition.”
In another phrase he gives you his point of view, “it is as if you
looked through a keyhole.”</p>

<p class='c021'>Descendant of Poussin and Ingres (when Ingres fell down in the
fit from which he never recovered, it was his pupil who carried him
out of his studio), Degas worships drawing, and line is with him a
cult. Japanese art has helped to mould his style, as it influenced
many of the Impressionists. His oil-paintings, though for the most
part correct in draughtsmanship, are frequently wiry and academic
in technique. Colour was never his strong point, and it is in his
pastels that we find the achievement of his life. In a masterly essay
on this artist, Thèodore Duret writes: “Degas has proved once
more that, with genius, subject is a secondary matter, merely its
opportunity, one may say. It is out of itself, out of its inner consciousness,
that the poetry and the beauty discovered in its production
are drawn. His work will thus remain one of the most powerful,
the most complete, and the most instinct with vitality amongst that
of the masters of the nineteenth century.”</p>

<p class='c021'>Of Degas personally little is known. He comes of an old
bourgeoise family, and at one time it is said that he possessed
considerable financial means, which he sacrificed in order to save a
brother from financial disaster. Although seventy years of age he
still works with excessive labour at the art over which he has gained
such a mastery. Scorning wealth, publicity, and popularity, he lives
a life of complete isolation, dispensing with friends, able to more
than hold his own against enemies.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='small'>DANCING GIRL · E. DEGAS</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>He has had two pupils whose names stand out prominently in
the art of to-day, the American artist Miss Mary Cassatt (referred to
elsewhere in this volume) and the caricaturist Forain. Degas has
always had a bitter wit, the dread of his contemporaries, and many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>of his sayings have passed into history. During the height of the
battle which raged around the Impressionists during the seventies, he
remarked concerning the academic painters and critics: “On nous
fusille, mais on fouille nos poches,” or, in other words, “They cover
us with injuries, yet they make use of our ideas.” In him Whistler
met his match. “My dear friend,” he said once to that great artist,
“you conduct yourself in life just as if you had no talent at all.”
Upon another occasion, speaking of Whistler when the latter was
having a number of photographic portraits taken, he observed
sarcastically, “You cannot talk to him; he throws his cloak around
him—and goes off to the photographer.” It was not likely that two
such spirits would appreciate each other.</p>

<p class='c021'>Degas is a pessimist. He has always been a realist, and the
realist in this troubled world cannot look through rosy spectacles;
acute pessimism becomes the natural result, especially when a great
city is the venue. He is the analyst and ironist of the Impressionist
group, with whom he has a sympathy of temperament rather than a
sympathy of technique. At the present moment there are few artists
better known in Paris, yet few who have received so small an amount
of official acknowledgment. He has never received an official commission,
has refused all decorations, his chief works are to be found in
foreign countries. Yet an enthusiastic French critic has summed up
the opinion of the art world of France in the striking phrase,
“Degas is one of the greatest draughtsmen who have ever lived.”</p>

<p class='c021'>Ten years ago, when the writer was a student in Paris, the
name of Toulouse-Lautrec was known only in connection with
various daring and flamboyant posters advertising the exotic attractions
of the “Moulin Rouge” and the “Divan Japonais,” and also
through extraordinary sketches which appeared from time to time
in Aristide Bruant’s feuilleton “Le Mirliton.” Now and again one
found a sketch, with his signature, pinned up in an artistic cabaret of
the Batignolles quarter. Few had seen him, nobody seemed to have
any wish to discover his whereabouts. In the studios he was almost
invariably spoken of with contempt as half a fool. He was
celebrated in a way, and yet unknown.</p>

<p class='c021'>He was by no means a fool, for few men have possessed a brighter
intellect. His semi-retirance and evident reluctance to appear
amidst the crowd were partly owing to a temperament of ultra-refinement,
and still more directly the result of a terrible personal
misfortune. The story of his life is romantic.</p>

<p class='c021'>Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec-Monfa was born in 1864 at Albi, a
scion of an ancient and illustrious family. His father, the Count
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>de Toulouse-Lautrec, was a wealthy country gentleman, of sporting
tastes, a splendid horseman, a crack shot, a sculptor, and a person of
most violent and impulsive temper. The son inherited many of his
father’s qualities. Generations of ancestors accustomed to the
beauties and refinements of such a life in the country had developed
at last an artist of peculiar sensibilities. These natural gifts were
carefully cultivated, and the boy became a professional artist, who,
although he possessed gifts of the most extreme refinement, became
through the irony of fate primarily famous amongst his countrymen
as a designer of street posters and comic sketches. Those who
knew him superficially could not comprehend how his delicate and
extraordinary exterior could cover such excellent qualities of heart,
such delicacy of spirit. He met with scant respect and few
patrons. Happily he was not dependent upon his brush for the
means of existence, and his works, when they sold, fetched but
little. After his sad and untimely death, the most insignificant
sketches were eagerly disputed for and changed hands at large
prices.</p>

<p class='c021'>Physically Toulouse-Lautrec was a weak man, of a highly-developed
nervous temperament, with a brain too active for its
frail tenement. To such a nature all excess proves fatal, although
it is generally such natures that seek excess. In his infancy the
artist had the unlucky mischance to break both his legs, and these,
badly set, left him malformed for life, a dwarf. Thoroughly
embittered, his proud and sensitive soul could not endure the
inquisitive stares of the curious with which he was invariably
greeted, and for the most part he lived a very solitary life. “Je
suis une demi-bouteille,” he would often say to his friends in
sarcastic reference to his own unhappy condition.</p>

<p><span class='small'>CAFÉ SCENE ON THE BOULEVARD MONTMARTRE · E. DEGAS</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>He drowned his griefs, as many have done before, keeping in
his studio huge stocks of the most fiery spirits and liqueurs, from
which he compounded wonderful “cocktails” for the benefit of himself
and his friends. It is not surprising that first came the madhouse
and then premature death completed this tragedy. Of an excitable
temperament he found much pleasure in resorts such as the “Moulin
Rouge.” Taverns, theatres, and the circus, found in him a constant
patron. These were his schools; and hundreds, one may say
thousands of sketches are the result of such teaching. He loved
horses as his ancestors had done before him, and he studied their
attitudes at the circus, sketching them in barbaric trappings and in
eccentric poses. The smell of the sawdust always inspired him.
The sketches here reproduced illustrate this phase of his career.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>M. Princeteau, the designer of sporting scenes, influenced
Lautrec’s style, and became his intimate friend. Forain also counts
for something in his development, whilst Pissarro and Renoir were
frequent visitors to and critics of the young Impressionist. Perhaps
of all men Degas inspired him most, and at times he undoubtedly
copied the methods of that master. With serious study he had
little to do. He worked in the atelier-Bonnat in 1883, and later on
in the atelier-Cormont, where he continued the study of the nude;
yet it was only after he had complete liberty and was entirely free
from scholastic influence that his style began to form. Then his
strong individuality displayed itself, and he became Toulouse-Lautrec
as we know him.</p>

AMONGST the artists who contributed paintings to
the eight exhibitions of the Impressionist group are
four women, who were influenced by the new
methods: Mdlle. Berthe Morisot, Madame Marie
Bracquemond, Miss Mary Cassatt, and Mdlle. Eva
Gonzalès.</p>

<p class='c021'>The story of Berthe Morisot is romantic. She was the great
grand-daughter of Fragonard, a famous beauty, a pupil of Manet,
then the wife of his brother Eugène. Her position in the art world
of France was unique, and her death at the early age of fifty in 1895
cut short a career devoted to a most charming and delicate style.
She excelled above all in two branches of her art—an exquisite
draughtsmanship and a most luminous and poetic sense of colour.
Technical difficulties never discouraged her. She was one of those
rare and fortunate individuals who can intuitively surmount any
problem and consequently hardly require a teacher. Madame
Eugène Manet was an artist to her finger-tips. Her work is
charged with a feminine charm sympathetic to the temperament of
any painter. Her canvases are iridescent poems in paint, and she
possessed many qualities in common with her illustrious ancestor.
“Only one woman created a style,” wrote the novelist George
Moore (who, it may be remembered, had a close acquaintanceship
with many of the Impressionists), “and that woman is Madame
Morisot. Her pictures are the only pictures painted by a woman
that could not be destroyed without creating a blank, a hiatus in the
history of art.” She was a woman of great personality and charm,
and took an active part in the furtherance of the movement which
was initiated by her brother-in-law. “My sister-in-law would
not have existed without me,” said Manet one day in the Rue
d’Amsterdam to George Moore, and the latter adds, “True, indeed,
that she would not have existed without him; and yet she has
something that he has not—the charm of an exquisite feminine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>fancy, the charm of her sex. Madame Morisot is the eighteenth
century quick with the nineteenth; she is in the nineteenth turning
her eyes regretfully looking back on the eighteenth.”</p>

<p class='c021'>Miss Mary Cassatt is an American subject. She was born at
Pittsburg, studied at the Philadelphia Academy, and then, after
some work with Degas, became an accomplished painter of children
and the varied scenes of maternity. A pastellist of note, with Raffaëlli
she succeeded in resuscitating the moribund art of etching in colour.
Miss Cassatt’s work shows evidence upon every side of unwearying
years of effort. Its dominant character is strength, and, with
the single exception of Berthe Morisot, the artist is probably one of
the most virile woman painters the world has seen. Strength is
decidedly not the keynote of any of the works of Angelica Kauffmann,
Madame Lebrun, or even of the many women who exhibit to-day,
although they display other qualities worthy of praise. Miss Cassatt
has experimented in numerous directions, has often tried to express
herself in a fresh way. She has succeeded. Her draughtsmanship
is exceptionally firm, and her colour bright, pure, and harmonious.
She has worked in oil, charcoal, water-colour, pastel, and etching,
and has remained faithful to the inspiration of her master Degas,
and through him to the art of Japan.</p>

<p class='c021'>The pastel drawing here reproduced is one of an extensive series
devoted to scenes from maternal life. Although from the nature of
things all such reproductions fall far short of the original, still a
good idea is conveyed of technique and composition. Miss Mary
Cassatt, it may be added, has travelled a great deal in search of
subject inspiration, and is the friend of the older members of the
original group of French Impressionists, to which she is allied by
sympathy and the work of a lifetime.</p>

<p class='c021'>Madame Marie Bracquemond was also an “Impressioniste,” and
joined ardently in the movement. At first following the example of
Ingres, her first teacher, she received the most valuable help from
her husband, an engraver of the rarest talent. The field of her art
ranges from a colossal decorative panel (those exhibited in the
Paris Exhibition of 1878 were about twenty-one feet by nine feet in
size) to a most delicate little etching. It may be understood that
mere physical labour did not appal her, for the Exhibition panels
required assiduous and heavy toil.</p>

<p class='c021'>Of Eva Gonzalès there is, unfortunately, little to be said. At
first taught by Chaplin, she became the favourite pupil of Edouard
Manet, and commenced to display much talent as a pastellist. She
married Henri Guérard, the engraver, but death ended at an untimely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>age a career of great promise. In the Luxembourg gallery she is
represented by a pastel drawing.</p>

<p class='c021'>It has been often said that in art women cannot create: they
can only assimilate and reproduce. In one sense this is true both
of Berthe Morisot and Mary Cassatt, the two principal figures in
this tiny feminine group. The first was profoundly influenced by
her brother-in-law Manet, the second by her teacher Degas. Marie
Bracquemond and Eva Gonzalès married husbands in the practice of
their art.</p>

<p class='c021'>But these women introduced into the stern methods of the early
Impressionists a feminine gaiety and charm which were reflected
upon the canvases of their “confrères,” and produced a certain
change of attitude. There was little light-heartedness in the work
of Manet before these women-painters joined the group, and it is
not altogether improbable that some of the change is due to their
example. In any body of men feminine influence always makes for
the good, and these women, of strong but charming personality,
must (it is idle to write any less emphatic word) have had a strong
influence upon the whole group. Their industry was great, for they
exhibited almost without intermission from 1874 to 1886. At
times their talent touches genius, and for future historians they
will prove an interesting study. Modernity is the note of Impressionism,
and that movement was the very first artistic revolt in
which women took a prominent part.</p>

THE work of Emile Claus is a manifestation in quite
another direction of the Impressionist idea. Born
in Western Flanders in 1849, he was the sixteenth
child of parents in very humble circumstances. Their
business in life was to supply with provisions the
boatmen who passed along on the river Lys. By
various means the boy, who had very early displayed a yearning for
the painter’s career, managed to evade all attempts to harness him in
the drudgery of the home life. A pastrycook, a railway watchman,
a linendraper’s assistant, these were a few of the vocations he was condemned
to try, yet from which he escaped. At last he set out for
Antwerp, with £7 in his pocket, and the warning that he need not
expect a penny more. In the city of Rubens he became a free pupil
of Professor de Keyser. All day long he studied in the Academy.
When night came he earned a livelihood by giving drawing-lessons,
acting as a sculptor’s “devil,” and colouring pictures of the Stations
of the Cross. At last, after many struggles, he became a popular
portrait-painter in the city, particularly of children in fancy costume.
In 1879 he travelled through Spain and Morocco, painting the conventional
compositions of an Iberian tour, and much influenced by
the style of Charles Verlat. Despite his great success in Antwerp,
in 1883 Emile Claus changed his manner entirely. He shook off
the dust of the city for ever, renounced portrait-painting, and
became “paysagiste.” Impelled by an intense love of nature he
returned to his native village on the banks of the Lys, and recommenced
his life as a landscape painter “en plein air.” He has
never returned to the distracting turmoil of town, and, in his quaint
white and green shuttered house at Astene between Ghent and
Courtrai, has buried himself in the heart of the country. Although
some distance from the larger cities of Belgium, Emile Claus
does not vegetate in his obscurity. On wheel or a-foot he is
equally active, visiting his friends and working on his canvases,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>of which he has always some six or eight in progress. It may
be noted that he works entirely in the open air, and finishes in
front of nature. One might judge of this from the strength and
completeness of his pictures.</p>

<p class='c021'>It is years since the writer first saw a landscape by Claus,
and he remembers vividly the pleasure it gave. The painting
was in the well-known collection of Mr. John Maddocks, of
Bradford. Upon a huge canvas the artist had depicted a cornfield
ripe for the sickle, and in the midst of the wheat red poppies
grew. Across the foreground, emerging from the wheat, wandered
a few white ducks. Over the whole was the fierce glare of a noon-day
sun. The work was convincing, naturalistic, yet poetic, inasmuch as
it seemed to chant the universal hymn of nature. It was a revelation
to those artists who found themselves in Bradford at that
period. Unknown and a stranger, Claus received in spirit silent
congratulations for his splendid achievement, which aroused in
several breasts a keen feeling of emulation. The artist writes:
“Mr. Maddocks has always strongly encouraged me, and had the
courage to buy my work at a time when everybody in Belgium
found me by far too audacious, because, as you may know, the
leaders, the standard-bearers as it were, of the young Belgian school
of painting are not at all in sympathy with the beautiful art of
Monet and his school.” Since that day Emile Claus has greatly
increased his following throughout the world, being least appreciated
in his own country.</p>

<p class='c021'>Emile Claus is a painter whose brush is charged with the sweetness
of life, courageous, healthful, and buoyant. His pictures
breathe of sunlight and fresh air, and it is easy to see with what
sheer delight he throws himself into his work. When one seeks
for the reason which so suddenly changed this prosaic painter of the
Antwerp bourgeois into an Impressionist of the most modern school,
one discovers the usual cause, the Englishmen of the commencement
of the last century. In a recent letter to the writer, Emile
Claus says that in England, above all other countries, were born light
and life in painting. “I have all too quickly glanced at the Turners
and Constables of London, nevertheless it was a revelation to me, and
those great artists Monet, Sisley, and Pissarro continue simply what
that giant Turner discovered; just as the grand epoch of Rousseau,
Millet, Dupré, and Corot, passed over Belgium to find their inspiration
in the marvellous works of the Dutch school.”</p>

<p class='c021'>In the country of the Lys the artist continues to work, producing
a series of pictures as beautiful as they are uncommon. One may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>mention his magnificent <i>Flemish Farm</i> of 1883, the <i>Old Gardener</i> of
1887 now in the Liége gallery, the canvas in the Antwerp gallery,
and the fine work by which he is represented in the Luxembourg.

</div>

<p class='c021'>In 1891, Claus exhibited for the first time in the Champ de
Mars, and has contributed each year from that date. His technical
skill grows steadily. M. Gabriel Mourey, staunch supporter of
“La peinture claire,” contributed a most sympathetic article to the
“Studio,” in which he wrote, “In the old days, Claus was accused
of being an ‘Impressionist,’ and such he is to a certain degree just
as any one may be without disrespect to the glorious traditions of the
painter’s art. He is an Impressionist to this extent—that he
possesses the gift of <i>feeling</i> with the utmost keenness the true meaning
of Nature in all her manifestations; while he is bound by no rule,
subject to no formula, in his endeavour to interpret that meaning on
his canvas. But, unlike most Impressionists, he has the rare
capacity to know how to choose his impressions, to test them to the
uttermost, and never to rest until he has translated them to his full
satisfaction, disdaining the haphazard attempts which are sufficient
for the majority of modern landscapists. Impressionist! One need
feel no surprise that the superficial observer dubs him thus; for
nowadays every painter whose work is luminous and bright, and
devoid of bitumen, earns and deserves the title! The truth is that
Claus, without adapting his style to any special method, is mainly
concerned that his works shall be as full of atmosphere as possible, that
his touch shall be as free and his colour as pure as he can make them.
Thus he achieves that remarkable freshness of tint, that brightness
of colouring, which constitute one of the chief charms of his art.”</p>

<p class='c021'>The little house near Astene is called in Flemish “Zonnenschyn”—“Sunshine,”
and it is indeed sunshine which is predominant
in the work of Emile Claus.</p>

<p class='c021'>Le Sidaner is an artist, who, after having passed through several
antagonistic stages, has developed a style entirely his own. He
may be described as a mystic who views the world with an air of
detachment, standing aloof from the distractions of its inhabitants.
He prefers an environment breathing some vague and undefined
sorrow. The joy of life does not course through his veins. The
subjects which appeal most to him suggest renunciation and world-weariness,
the solemn peace of a Flemish <i>béguinage</i>, a cobbled street
in Bruges recalling dead glories, a deserted canal with a solitary
swan. When he designs a figure-composition the subject belongs
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>to the same <i>genre</i>, a priest administering extreme unction to a dying
girl, orphans under the care of a nun, old women waiting with the
patience of extreme old age for Death to release them from their
suffering senility. He instils into his canvases the very essence of
Keats’ line, “Sorrow more beautiful than beauty’s self.”</p>

<p class='c021'>The only biographical account of Le Sidaner is to be found in
one of M. Gabriel Mourey’s penetrating articles in the “Studio.”
Le Sidaner was the son of fisherfolk from St. Malo and the Ile
Bréhat. He was born in 1862, and spent the first ten years of his
life in his native place, the Ile Maurice. “While quite young,”
says the writer of the preface to the catalogue of an exhibition held
in 1897, “he came to live in Dunkirk, beside the murmuring North
Sea, with its melancholy mists. The shock he felt at the change
made him absolutely pensive. It was as though, half alarmed, he
was taking refuge within himself the better to express the flame of
Creole tenderness which burned within him.” His father, who
practised painting and sculpture as an amateur, gave the boy every
encouragement. At fifteen he was taken away from school, and
sent to the local École des Beaux-Arts. Here he studied under a
master who was slave to the doctrines of the Antwerp school.</p>

<p class='c021'>The artist, when telling his early experiences, deplored these evil
influences. He admits that they were not worse than those forced
upon him in Paris, where, at the École des Beaux-Arts, he studied
under Cabanel. Five years he spent under that master, making
sketches of the animals at the Jardin des Plantes, and copying
Delacroix and Jordaens at the Louvre. Then he passed under the
influence of Impressionism. He says: “It was in this year (1881)
that Manet displayed his portraits of <i>Pertuiset, le tueur de lions</i>, and
of <i>Rochefort</i>. The first of these pleased me infinitely, but the second
gradually filled me with alarm; it was so different from that which
I had hitherto seen. Nevertheless, I remember well that the
famous <i>Bar des Folies-Bergère</i> by this same Manet made the profoundest
impression on me. Yet the rules of the school forbade
me to consider all this as beautiful as I could have wished to
consider it. When I look back on those days it really seems as
though I was poisoned. Etaples, that is to say Nature, revived me,
and drove the drug from my system.”</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='small'>APPLE GATHERING · EMILE CLAUS</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Le Sidaner goes on to tell how by chance he spent a holiday at
Etaples in 1881. He settled there, and remained in the little coast
town from 1884 to 1893, where he made friendships with Eugène
Vail, Thaulow, Henri Duhem, Alexander Harrison, and others.
He refers to a visit to Holland, where Rembrandt, Peter de Hoogh,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>and Vermeer enchanted him. Having gained a third medal at the
Salon des Champs-Élysées he was able to travel to Italy. “Italy
simply turned my head, particularly Florence. Oh! the delicious
hours I spent in the Convent of San Marco copying the face of the
Virgin in Fra Angelico’s <i>Annunciation</i>. How much I preferred the
simple grace of Fra Angelico and Giotto to the cleverness and skill of
Titian, Veronese, and Tintoretto.” It was hardly necessary to have
avowed these influences, they are so evident in the work of Le Sidaner.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='small'>A SUNLIT HOUSE · EMILE CLAUS</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>He is a man who avoids crowds and the distracting clamour of
humanity, loving to work in such dead cities as Bruges, or the
peaceful countryside in the neighbourhood of Beauvais. No modern
artist has better expressed on canvas the words of the great Millet.
“When you paint a picture, whether the subject be a house, a plain,
the ocean, or the sky, remember always the presence of man. Think
how his joys and sorrows have been intermixed in these landscapes.
An inner voice speaks of his inquietude and turmoils. Humanity’s
whole existence is conjured up. In painting a landscape think of man.”</p>

<p class='c021'>Le Sidaner has many affinities to Pointelin, Carrière, and
Whistler. They each have sought harmonies of line and colour,
and though distinct in personality and unlike in methods, they have
produced wonderfully similar effects. One of the most impressive
of Le Sidaner’s works is <i>La Table</i> in the Luxembourg. Here is
the unmistakable Impressionist technique. In the courtyard of a
country house is spread a table, white with napery, upon which
stands a glowing opalescent lamp. A calm summer moon diffuses
a gentle light over the whole scene. No human figures disturb
the peaceful atmosphere, yet the sentiment of their presence pervades
the place. The painting is a little masterpiece of its kind.
The first canvas exhibited at the Champs-Élysées in 1887 was
entitled <i>After Church</i>. Since that time he has exhibited year after
year, the subjects of his pictures being well explained by their
French titles: <i>La Promenade des Orphelines</i>, <i>Communion in Extremis</i>,
<i>Benediction de la Mer</i> (1891), <i>Jeune fille Hollandaise</i> (1892), <i>L’autel
des Orphelines</i> (1893), <i>Départ de Tobie</i> (1894), <i>Les Promis</i>, and <i>Les
Vieilles</i> (1895). In 1900 he exhibited a notable collection of pictures
of Bruges.</p>

<p class='c021'>Le Sidaner paints a world of dreams. No better description of
his work can be found than in the words of Moore:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c023'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c025'><span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>English readers and artists have hardly yet made the acquaintance
of Besnard. To continental art-lovers he has long been known as
the strongest and most audacious of the young men in the movement,
and is thoroughly Impressionist in his ideas and methods.
Few living artists have had the good fortune to be so much discussed
as M. Besnard. Each Salon brings its chorus of admiration,
its storm of disapprobation. The height of the argument was
reached a few years ago, when, at the New Salon, the artist exhibited
his <i>Ponies worried by Flies</i>. A startling piece of colour, it
created a strong impression upon those who saw it. At that moment
the existence of the violet tints in nature, which had been so beautifully
demonstrated by Monet in his series of <i>Les Cathédrales</i> and by
Sisley in his charming river studies, was much under discussion in
the studios. In some of the works of Monet and Sisley the whole
picture is saturated in a glow of violet, which is frequently to be
found in nature, particularly in northern France. Those who had
not seen this natural effect disbelieved in its existence and charged
the artists with painting “de chic.” Those who had seen it and
essayed the difficult task of reproducing it upon canvas, loudly
proclaimed its truths. Then came the <i>Ponies worried by Flies</i>.
Besnard had heard of the heated discussion raging round the violet
tints, and, having observed the truth of the effect, determined to
demonstrate it in paint. Never had been seen in any Salon such
a blaze of colour as this. The composition seemed to be but a peg
upon which to hang a sermon in technique. Violet, violent in
colour, pure hot impasto as shadow, juxtaposed directly to its
natural complement of light in the shape of orange and citron
colours, brilliantly loud and unadulterated. A sensation was created,
and disbelief in the existence of violet tints in nature for ever
silenced. M. Besnard has followed this success with many other
surprising themes, for it is his pleasure to amaze. He seeks incessantly
the new and incongruous.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Besnard’s talent has been, and continues to be, publicly recognised.
The municipality of Paris yearly expends large sums of money in
securing the best available skill for decorating the public buildings
in its charge. In this laudable custom it is followed by every town
of any importance throughout the country. Lavishly patronised by
the Government, the municipalities, wealthy private collectors, and
the sentiment of the people generally, artists thrive in France and
multiply. In whatever respect—if any—in which France may be
found lagging behind the nations, in Art she must by the very reason
of things remain supreme, for Art is a part of her daily life. Besnard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>has been lucky with his commissions. He was called upon to assist
in the decoration of the magnificent Hôtel de Ville of Paris, in the
Town Hall of the First Arrondissement, in the lecture hall of the
Sorbonne, and with the frescoes in the School of Pharmacy. In
all these decorations one finds colour and composition as original as
bizarre, harmonious yet forcible. All students of modern painting
should not fail to see these works, the most striking in execution of
the last few years. The artist’s atelier is also always open to connoisseurs,
and it will be found to be crowded with sketches and
pictures in progress, each one unmistakably the handiwork of a
master craftsman.</p>

<p class='c013'>Five of Besnard’s canvases have been bought by the Government,
and all are now to be found in the Luxembourg, an honour few
artists can boast of. A list is given for reference. The first of the
series is a portrait of the artist, the others being entitled <i>Femme qui se
chauffe</i>, <i>La Morte</i>, <i>Port d’Alger au Crépuscule</i>, and <i>Entre deux Rayons</i>.
The second and third are excellent examples of a branch of art in
which Besnard is supreme. His nudes and portraits are wonderfully
fine in drawing, and bewitching in colour. They will form his
greatest claim to future immortality.</p>

<p class='c013'>Besnard is a particularly sympathetic lover of horses, and no
one can more naturally reproduce them in paint than he. His
chief recreation is driving, and he is often to be seen “tooling”
along the roads of the Bois de Boulogne and other suburbs of Paris.
There is little to add personally about Albert Paul Besnard. He
was born in Paris, married Mdlle. Dubray, a sculptor of much
talent, and resides in the Rue Guillaume Tell. His career has been
a continued series of success upon success, and at the present
moment he is one of the shining stars of contemporary art in
France.</p>

<p class='c013'>Allied to the later phase of the Impressionist movement, although
not actually identified with the group of artists known as the typical
Impressionists, is Didier-Pouget. His habitual manner of regarding
Nature, his pure and cheerful colours, and his natural temperament,
include him in this survey of workers in “la peinture claire.” He
has a special gift of composition, “mise en plan,” as the French
say, a strong feeling for balance and form. He is at his best when
depicting morning and sunset effects. His scenes of heather bathed
in sunshine or glistening with the dew of an autumnal sunrise are
rendered with an exceptional verisimilitude, strength, and truth.</p>

<p class='c013'>Didier-Pouget was born at Toulouse in 1864, the son of the
editor of one of the local journals. His father, a great lover of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>Nature, gave the boy every encouragement in his ambition to become
an artist. It was the custom of father and son to take long country
walks, and the elder would point out natural beauties and discuss
the methods of their pictorial representation, relating at the same
time biographical details of the great artists, and in every way
endeavouring to train the child and sustain his ideals. After
Didier-Pouget had passed through a plain schooling, professors were
engaged, notably MM. Auguin and Baudit. For the latter (a
local artist of genius, who, had he forsaken the quieter life of the
provinces for the glare of Parisian publicity, should have attained
to the highest honours an artist can reach) his old pupil has still
much admiration. Then Didier-Pouget passed into the studio of
Lalanne, the celebrated etcher and illustrator. Under these influences
many profitable years were spent, the seed-time of a most fruitful
career.</p>

<p class='c013'>Locally the youth was regarded as a prodigy of talent, and great
things were expected of him. Pictures were exhibited in the
provinces which attracted much appreciation, and found many
purchasers. Thus encouraged, the artist sought a wider audience,
and went to Paris. It was a wise step, and Fortune smiled on him
from the first. From 1886 he has exhibited year by year at the
Salon, each fresh season showing a marked advance in his art,
bringing to the world of Paris new and delightful colour-schemes
and vivid compositions.</p>

<p class='c013'>Didier-Pouget achieved his “Mention Honorable” in 1890,
won the “Concours Troyon” the following year, and was awarded
the gold medal at the Salon in 1896 upon the recommendation of
Gérôme, hitherto a strong opponent to the new style. He is now a
Chevalier of the Legion of Honour, his medals, diplomas, and
awards from foreign exhibitions and Governments being almost
innumerable. Such a measure of success is rarely achieved nowadays
by a man under forty in the arduous profession of art. The State
and the municipality of Paris are amongst his most regular patrons.
Besides the pictures reserved for Paris, he is represented in the
museums of Lyons, Macon, Toulouse, Tunis, the Embassy at St.
Petersburg, the galleries of Boston, U.S.A., and Leipsic, and the
private collections of the Kings of Italy and Greece.</p>

<p class='c013'>Personally Didier-Pouget is more Spanish than French. Of
medium height, tanned complexion, black hair, dark eyes which
tell unmistakably of the artist, very reserved in manner, and
modest to a degree—these are his characteristics. He leads a solitary
life in the Boulevard de Clichy. In his large studio will probably
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>be found the canvas he is working upon, about ten feet by six, his
favourite size. Innumerable studies are scattered around, rapid
sketches of form and colour, line-drawings, careful black-and-white
work full of detail, in fact every trifle which will aid him in

<p class='c012'>If the greatest art is to represent an impression of Nature at her
best, then the work of Didier-Pouget is great. “It is truly worth
while being a painter to have produced any one of these,” writes
the critic of “Le Temps.” The artist loves best to represent Nature
in her peaceful moods, and generally seeks the solitudes of the exquisite
hills, valleys, and rivers of the Tarbes countryside, or the
rich watershed of La Creuse. Here, in the fresh early-morn,
charged with dew and mist, he finds his subjects, overlooking
magnificent panoramas of river, hillsides covered with heather,
across valleys and plains from which loom out sculpturesque masses
of foliage, dark and strong against the blue mist and distant mountain
ridge. The painter prefers Nature serene and undisturbed,
and introduces but little incident.</p>

<p class='c013'>It need hardly be said that his palette is free from all blacks,
browns, ochres, or earth-colours generally, and that his strongest
“effects” are gained by the juxtaposition of pure tints in harmonious
contrast. His favourite colour-scheme seems to be the
composition of subtle arrangements in yellow and blue, or pink and
green. He contributes regularly to the Salon, yearly producing
from two to four canvases of the size mentioned, and in these days
of a limited market and unlimited talent, he invariably finds
purchasers. So fortunate has he been that his numerous friends
have but one fear for his future, that his enormous success may
hasten a tendency to stereotype his compositions. Didier-Pouget
is doubtless aware of this danger, and will probably follow his
present aims in a manner which will not disfigure or flaw a most
brilliant career.</p>

MR. WHISTLER’S personality was one of the most
striking in the art world of the last forty years, and
his death was an irreparable loss. That he will rank
as one of the greatest masters of the nineteenth century
there can be no doubt. As an Impressionist with a
strong individuality his work requires attention in
this volume.</p>

<p class='c021'>The Whistler family came originally from England, chiefly from
the neighbourhoods of Whitchurch and Goring-on-Thames. A
notable ancestor was Daniel Whistler, President of the Royal College
of Physicians of England in the reign of Charles II. Several references
to this “quaint gentleman of rare humour” are to be found in
the pages of ‘Pepys’ Diary,’ and the family trait reappeared (with
emphasis) in the character of the famous artist. James Abbott
McNeill Whistler was born at Lowell, Massachusetts, in 1834, his
father being Major George Washington Whistler, for some time
consulting engineer to the St. Petersburg and Moscow Railway.
The son was destined for a military career, and received a considerable
amount of tuition at the Government College at West Point. Work
as a cadet, and also on the coast survey, does not seem to have interested
him. In the fifties he migrated to Paris and became a student
in the atelier of Gleyre, two of his fellow pupils being Sir Edward
Poynter and George du Maurier. Whistler cannot have had much
sympathy with the art in vogue at that time, a degenerated style
based upon a sentimental classicalism. He found his best friends
amongst young Frenchmen with extremely different ideas, men such
as Fantin-Latour, Bracquemond, Degas, Manet, Duret, Claude
Monet, and many others. Whistler first acquired fame as an etcher,
and his first set of plates, known as the “little French set,” amply
justifies the welcome with which it was received. From that early
date until his death he has been acknowledged pre-eminent in the
etcher’s delicate and graceful art.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>At the Salon de Refusés (to which frequent reference has already
been made) Whistler exhibited his first important painting, the
<i>Little White Girl, Symphony in White No. 2</i>. It created his reputation
as a painter, and remains one of the most charming of his canvases.
An early contribution to the Royal Academy was entitled <i>At the
Piano</i>, and clearly showed that the artist was then dominated by the
subtle influence of Dante Gabriel Rossetti. This influence was
quickly discarded, for Rossetti’s talent was inferior to that of the
gifted American.</p>

<p class='c021'>It has often been said that Whistler was never welcomed at the
Royal Academy. This point remains debatable; the fact remains
that the artist was constantly in evidence during the early part of his
career. In 1859 he exhibited <i>two etchings from nature</i> (the title given
in the catalogue to one frame); in 1860 the celebrated <i>At the Piano</i>
(which was bought by an Academician) and five other works,
namely, <i>Monsieur Astruc, Rédacteur du Journal l’Artiste</i> (Drypoint);
<i>Thames—Black Lion Wharf</i>; <i>Portrait</i> (Drypoint); <i>W. Jones, Lime
Burner, Thames Street</i> (Etching); and <i>The Thames, from the Tunnel Pier</i>.
In 1861 he was represented by one canvas, <i>La Mère Gérard</i>, together
with <i>Thames from New Crane Wharf</i> (Etching); <i>Monsieur Oxenfeld,
Littérateur, Paris</i> (Drypoint); <i>The Thames, near Limehouse</i> (Etching).
In 1862 he sent two paintings, <i>The Twenty-Fifth of December, 1860, on
the Thames, Alone with the Tide</i>; and <i>Rotherhithe</i> (Etching). The next
year, 1863, was prolific. The catalogue contains the following titles:
<i>The Last of Old Westminster</i>; <i>Weary</i> (Drypoint); <i>Old Westminster
Bridge</i>; <i>Hungerford Bridge</i> (Etching); <i>The Forge</i> (Drypoint); <i>Monsieur
Becgis</i> (Etching); <i>The Pool</i> (Drypoint). Two works were on view in
1864: <i>Wapping</i> and <i>Die Lange Lizen—of the Six Marks</i>. In 1865 he
exhibited <i>The Golden Screen</i>; <i>Old Battersea Bridge</i>; <i>The Little White
Girl</i> (with a quotation in the catalogue of fourteen lines from Swinburne);
and <i>The Scarf</i>. Whistler was not represented in 1866, but in
1867 exhibited the <i>Symphony in White No. 3</i>; <i>Battersea</i>; and <i>Sea and
Rain</i>. After a break of two years came <i>The Balcony</i> in the Academy
of 1870. The next year’s catalogue does not contain his name, but
in 1872 the Academy accepted that exquisite example of his art, now
in the Luxembourg, <i>Arrangement in Grey and Black: Portrait of the
Painter’s Mother</i>. For six years Whistler was an absentee, being represented
for the last time on the walls of Burlington House, in
1879, by <i>Old Putney Bridge</i> (Etching).</p>

</div>

<p class='c021'>The majority of Whistler’s masterpieces were exhibited at the
Grosvenor Gallery in the days when Sir Coutts Lindsay was at the
head of the direction. The walls of the rooms in Bond Street were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>repeatedly adorned by those charming creations known as <i>Nocturnes</i>
and <i>Symphonies</i>, by the remarkable <i>Valparaiso</i>, by many of the
portraits, notably <i>Lady Archibald Campbell</i>, <i>Carlyle</i>, and the delightful
<i>Miss Alexander</i>. Twenty years ago Whistler’s life in London
and Paris was exceptionally active. In him Society discovered a
wit of Gallic alertness, and he speedily became one of the most
prominent characters of the day. Readers will remember the oft-told
tale of how Whistler sacrificed (with a true Whistlerian light-heartedness)
much costly Cordovan leather, in order that he might
create a masterpiece of decoration in the celebrated Leyland mansion.
Another historic story is the <i>cause célèbre</i> of Whistler <i>v.</i> Ruskin,
based upon the criticism of a Grosvenor Gallery nocturne as “a pot
of paint flung in the public face,” with the resultant farthing
damages. The canvas which called forth this elegant banter
was that entitled <i>Nocturne in Black and Gold; the Fire Wheel</i>, the
theme being a display of fireworks in the gardens at Cremorne.
From a literary point of view, as a writer of biting sarcasm the
artist scarcely had a peer. One admires that lively <i>jeu d’esprit</i>
“Ten o’clock,” and the strange mixture of correspondence entitled
“The Gentle Art of Making Enemies” will not be out of date
until all the shining lights of the present generation have been
forgotten.</p>

<p class='c021'>After two years of probationship as an ordinary member, in 1886
Whistler became President of the Royal Society of British Artists,
an old-established and hitherto staid and conservative institution.
His term of office was brilliant and exciting; he himself exhibited
such wonderful pictures as the <i>Sarasate</i>, and his reputation attracted
the most talented of the younger artists of the day. The correspondence
which ensued when Whistler vacated the presidential chair must
be sought for in “The Gentle Art of Making Enemies.”</p>

<p class='c021'>In Whistler’s work there is a curious yet indefinable influence of
Japanese painting. In company with most of the Impressionists, he
was influenced by those Impressionists of another race. This
influence is to be observed in all modern painting since 1870,
when artists first commenced to collect examples of the Japanese
methods.</p>

<p class='c021'>In his later years Whistler preferred the atmosphere of Paris to
that of London, although he continued to visit occasionally the
country he described as “humourless and dull.” The artist was
thoroughly cosmopolitan, and was equally at home in New York,
Paris, or London. His influence upon the art of to-day has been
unmistakable, and one has little doubt as to its permanency.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>Whistler helped to purge art of the vice of subject, and the belief
that the mission of the artist is to copy nature.</p>

<p><span class='small'>ALEXANDER HARRISON</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Mr. Alexander Harrison is one of those numerous American
artists who have settled in France, a natural result of French training
and French sympathies. Inspired by Manet, influenced by Besnard,
he has painted some of the most successful Impressionist work of
the last fifteen years. One cannot agree always with Dr. Muther in
his learned and not altogether satisfactory tomes, but his appreciation
of Mr. Harrison is so delicate and just that it is worth reproducing.
“<i>In Arcady</i>,” he writes, “was one of the finest studies of light
which have been painted since Manet. The manner in which the
sunlight fell upon the high grass and slender trees, its rays gliding
over branch and shrub, touching the green blades like shining gold,
and glancing over the nude bodies of fair women—here over a hand,
here over a shoulder, and here again over the bosom—was painted
with such virtuosity, felt with such poetry, and so free from all the
heaviness of earth, that one hardly had the sense of looking at a
picture at all.” The luminous painting of Besnard had here reached
its final expression, and the summit of classic finish was surmounted.
His third picture was called <i>The Wave</i>. To seize such phenomena
of Nature in their completeness—things so fickle and so hard to
arrest in their mutability—had been the chief study of French
painters since Manet. When Harrison exhibited his <i>Wave</i>, sea-pieces
by Duez, Roll, and Victor Binet were also in existence; but
Harrison’s <i>Wave</i> was the best of them all.</p>

<p><span class='small'>THE WAVE · ALEXANDER HARRISON</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Harrison’s vast studio in Paris breathes of the sea. The painter
is an ardent yachtsman, and traces of his recreation are numerous.
Here are to be found dozens of canvases, rolled up, piled in bundles,
hung haphazard against the walls, each one telling some different
story of the waters. These studies, probably worked upon in the
neighbourhoods of Pould’hu or Begmiel, are often actually salted
and sanded by contact with the elements which dash against the
wild but lovely Breton shores. No modern man paints seascapes
like Harrison. He produces effects which are evidently the results
of patient vigil and watching, as well as a vigorous power of brushwork.
They are transcripts of the ocean, which can only be seen as
the sun rises out of the east over the waters, pale lilac tints, softly
fading into citron, or gaining added strength in vermilion or deep
orange reflected from the passing clouds, whilst sweeping ripples
(one can almost hear their rhythmic cadence) are gently lost across
the expanse of ethereal, glistening sand.</p>

<p><span class='small'>SUNLIGHT ON THE LAKE · CHILDE HASSAM</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>In other pictures we see the tide at full flood; nature is in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>fairer mood, and the universe glows with an exquisite green. The
waves, of a glassy transparency, are for the moment held in check
by a supreme power. Such passing phases of Nature Mr. Harrison
seizes with unerring touch. Another branch of his work, already
referred to in speaking of the picture <i>In Arcady</i>, are the paintings
of the nude amidst the actual surrounding of the fields. Part of
their success may be ascribed to the fact that they have been painted
in each case in the open air. From the photographs, which Mr.
Harrison has allowed us to reproduce, both sides of his beautiful
talent may be judged. Like most Impressionists, his art breathes of
a love and joy with Nature as seen by a temperament refined,
distinguished, one may add—aristocratic.</p>

<p class='c021'>In the days when Florida was a primæval wilderness Mr. Harrison
as a very young man entered the United States Coast Survey.
Whistler, it may be remembered, commenced his career under the
auspices of the same department. Florida was just the place for an
adventurous youth, and Harrison was interested in his work. His
enthusiasm, coupled with his ability, resulted in being intrusted
with most of the difficult and sometimes dangerous “reconnaissance”
engineering scout work that called for lonely jaunts and camping
out amongst the swamps and lagoons.</p>

<p class='c021'>After four years on the Florida coast the party moved on to
Puget Sound. The young men connected with the survey had been
dabbling for some time in the use of water-colours, and Harrison
found that the artist in him was winning ascendency over the surveyor.
An argument with the head of the survey settled the matter. Mr.
Harrison went to San Francisco, and then travelled to Paris, and
studied under Gérôme. He was in his twenty-sixth year, and conscious
that his career was midway between success and failure. He
exhibited at the Salon a picture <i>Châteaux en Espagne</i>, a boy stretched
on his back in the sand of a warm, dry beach, wrapt in the spell of
a day-dream. “It was rather symbolic,” said the artist once as he
gazed at the photograph, “of my own state of mind at that time.”</p>

<p class='c021'>During the next ten years he was engaged in painting nudes in
the open air. His chief source of inspiration was his friend Bastien-Lepage,
with whom he travelled to Brittany. Harrison’s first success
was <i>In Arcady</i>, now in the Luxembourg. A recent journalistic
interview elicited many interesting facts about Mr. Harrison’s
method of work. The writer concludes: “Mr. Harrison’s usual
haunt in Brittany is Begmiel. Here there is a sandy peninsula
jutting into the sea, whence you can watch the sun go down on the
one horizon, and the moon come up from the other. He does not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>carry his paint-box about with him taking notes. Memory and
imagination, knowledge and power of visualisation, take psychic
photographs. It is not to be gathered from this that Mr. Harrison
is unerring. He has scraped out as many yards of painted canvas as
any man. But where his strength undeniably exists is in this
subjective, rather than objective, genius for instantaneous notation.
When he comes to put the picture on the canvas—now mark the
importance of early influences—he becomes the young surveyor
again engaged in reconnaissance. He takes his embryonic map (a
small canvas) and puts down his known points. He knows just
what spot of colour was here, what broken line there. The more
he puts down the more he sees, and presently the little map is
finished. The first map finished a larger size is made, and, if all
goes well, perhaps one larger still, and we have a great picture like
any one of those exhibited by the artist at the Salon of the Société
Nationale.”</p>

<p class='c021'>It is hardly necessary to add that this artist is an officer of the
Legion of Honour, and has received numerous medals and other
awards. Of the Franco-American school of painting he is one of the
recognised heads, and this has been acknowledged by his election to
the chief art societies of Paris, New York, Berlin, and Munich,
whilst he is represented in the permanent collections of the
Luxembourg, the Royal Gallery, Dresden, the Museum at Quimper,
and the American galleries of Philadelphia, Washington, Chicago,
St. Louis, and San Francisco.</p>

<p class='c021'>Childe Hassam is a young American artist who has been strongly
influenced by Impressionism. Originally from Boston, he worked
for several years in Paris, and when he returned to the States had
already some reputation. In New York he has “rendered the street
life in fresh and fleeting sketches; snow, smoke, and flaring gaslight
pouring through the shop-windows, quivering out into the night,
and reflected in an intense blaze upon the faces of men and women.”
A typical example of his work in this <i>genre</i> is <i>Seventh Avenue, New
York</i>. Childe Hassam is an associate of the Société Nationale des
Beaux-Arts, a member of the Secession of Munich, the American
Water Colour Society, and numerous clubs and societies throughout
the States. He has received medals at many of the recent International
Exhibitions, including that of Paris in 1889, whilst he is
represented in several of the continental and transatlantic galleries.
Being still young and enthusiastic, much may be expected of
Mr. Hassam in the future.</p>

GERMANY has been strongly affected by the French
movement, as in fact has been the whole of the Continent.
Any person who can remember the state
of art in the Fatherland twenty years ago will notice
the great change now taking place. He need only
revisit the country and wander through the great
annual exhibitions held in the larger cities, such as Berlin, Munich,
and Dresden. In 1878 the “Gazette des Beaux-Arts,” referring to
the German school of painting, said: “There are one or two artists
of the first rank, and many men of talent, but in other respects
German painting is still upon the level of the schools which had
their day amongst us thirty years ago; this is the solitary school of
painting which does not seem to perceive that the age of railways
and World Exhibitions needs an art different from that of the age of
philosophy and provincial isolation.” Since that date, in the manner
of viewing nature, in the choice of subject, in the style, composition,
technique, and colour of pictures, the main trend of German art has
been completely altered. Until quite recently Teutonic artists
delighted in the allegorical. The output of fabulous monsters, fauns,
unicorns, satyrs, was enormous. Every young painter turned his
hand to the production of these fantastic mythological subjects.
Happily a saner view of the mission of art has come over the land,
and the fauns and satyrs are being gradually relegated to oblivion.
From an absurd pseudo-classical style (the effect of teaching from
men like Couture and Munkacsy), together with unlimited use of
bitumen and black, a national school of painting has been evolved
which follows “la peinture claire,” giving promise that in time it
will travel, as regards purity of colour and brilliance of effect, far
beyond the bounds Monet has restricted himself to. Work “en
plein air” is the vogue, and no longer the exception, whilst the sun
is recognised at his true worth in the universal scheme of nature.
Hitherto King Sol has been disregarded, and his presence but rarely
indicated in some low-toned sunrise, or a sunset effect—the conventional
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>chrome-yellow band across a deep Prussian-blue hill distance.
Following the lead of the artists, both critics and public are being
gradually weaned from the love of black shadows, although it cannot
be said that they are wholly converted. Still their education is
in rapid progress, and the German people will soon be abreast of the
times in matters artistic.</p>

<p class='c021'>One man, Max Liebermann, has brought about this healthy
state of things almost single-handed. A consideration of his lifework
is of the highest importance and interest to all concerned either
with the progress of German art or the movement of French impressionism,
for Liebermann is a master, head and shoulders above
all his colleagues. His artistic history is easy to trace. The greatest
painters are always primarily attracted by the work of other great
men. They copy the models of their choice, and, missing some of
the peculiar qualities enshrined therein, gradually replace them in
their own works with something equally fine. These fresh qualities
will in their turn find admirers, and, fanning the zeal of newcomers,
keep alight throughout the ages the sacred flame of art. If Delacroix
borrowed from Constable, Manet borrowed from Delacroix,
and Liebermann from Manet. In his turn, Liebermann has influenced
a large and increasing number of young German and Dutch artists.</p>

<p class='c021'>With his pre-eminent position as a representative German painter,
Max Liebermann combines a commanding and active personality.
More than any other man of his time, his work has provoked discussion
and attracted attention from the commencement. During
the last thirty years he has fought strenuously the battle of light in
painting. Strongly influenced by Manet, Monet, together with
Millet and the Barbizon school, he has succeeded in inculcating
amongst his brother artists a love of actuality in subject, a desire to
work direct from nature (contrary to that old method of painting in
the semi-gloom of the studio from incongruous models in more or
less correct costume), together with the simplification and purification
of the palette. Liebermann has taught German artists to
look at nature as it is, and not to represent it as seen through the
veil of a deadening academic tradition; he has taught them that
art does not consist in a minute finish, that there is no finality in
nature, and that the last impression which a true work of art should
convey is that of excessive industry.</p>

<p><span class='small'>THE COBBLERS · MAX LIEBERMANN</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Max Liebermann was born in Berlin, July 29, 1849, the son of
a wealthy merchant. At an early age he decided to become an
artist, but the fulfilment of his wish was opposed by his father, who
suggested a course of philosophy at the University of Berlin as an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>antidote. Young Liebermann joined the faculty of philosophy, but
at the same time worked in Steffeck’s studio where he made quick
progress. He assisted his master, we are told, in the battle picture
<i>Sadowa</i>, painting guns, sabres, uniforms, and hands, with much approbation
from Steffeck. He frequented the galleries and museums
in preference to the class-rooms, and preferred to sketch in the
streets and parks of Berlin rather than sit at the feet of a professor at
the University. In 1869, with parental authority, he deserted
philosophy altogether, and joined the Academy at Weimar, then in
high repute as a school of art producing the regulation painters of
orthodox pattern. Here he worked for three years under Thumann
and Pauwels, beginning pictures in their style which were left unfinished.
The petrified classicalism which reigned in Weimar was
little acceptable to a youth who had keenly studied the life around
him, and who had developed a strong love for natural effects as well
as modernity in technique. These heretical tendencies were sternly
repressed by his respectable and erudite teachers. At last Liebermann
threw aside artificiality, and, quitting the circles of the conservative
Academy, occupied himself in painting in the open air.</p>

<p class='c021'>In 1873 he finished his first great picture, <i>Women plucking Geese</i>,
now in the National Gallery, Berlin. It was more or less academic
as to technique, and black tones predominated throughout in accordance
with the fashion of the period. The subject brought the canvas
into immediate notoriety, the picture was condemned as a gross vulgarity,
and Liebermann was described as “the apostle of ugliness.”
This hostile reception was entirely unexpected by the sensitive artist,
who was much affected by it, and determined to leave Berlin for
Paris.</p>

<p class='c021'>Thirty years ago the bituminous method of Munkacsy was the
most popular art in Germany, and influenced many of the younger
painters, Liebermann included. Upon his arrival in Paris the artist
sought out the great Hungarian, and asked for advice. The result of
the interview was that Liebermann quitted Paris for Holland.
Munkacsy was at that time, as Dr. Muther remarks, under the
influence of Ribot, and confirmed Liebermann in his preference for
heavy Bolognese shadows. It was not until he came to know the
works of Troyon, Daubigny, and Corot, that he liberated himself
from the influence of the school of Courbet. As subsequent events
proved, the advice given by Munkacsy was good and to the point,
and Liebermann acknowledges his great obligation to the painter of
<i>Christ before Pilate</i>.</p>

<p class='c021'>The first motive of importance which Liebermann found in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>Low Countries resulted in the picture <i>Women preserving Vegetables</i>,
completed at Weimar in 1873, and exhibited at the Salon of the same
year. The subject represents a group of women in a dimly lit barn
busily engaged in preserving cabbages and other vegetables. The
canvas, although a great advance upon its predecessors, was
ungraciously received in Germany. So little appreciation did
Liebermann receive that he definitely removed to Paris, where he
knew a welcome awaited him. In “la ville lumière” he worked in
the schools and museums, studied Troyon, Daubigny, and Millet,
whilst the influence of Manet, Monet, and the other Impressionists,
was an important factor in the development of his art.</p>

<p class='c021'>So strong was his admiration for Millet that he went down to
Barbizon, where he arrived shortly before the death of that great
artist. Under the influence of Millet he painted <i>Labourers in the
Turnip Field</i>, and <i>Brother and Sister</i>, which appeared in the Paris
Salon of 1876. He now reached the turning-point of his career,
for he had made up his mind that at all costs he must perfect his own
individual style. A great unrest, useless to battle against, disorganised
his movements. He travelled through Belgium, Holland, Germany,
and Italy, studying and searching for the inspiration which should
place him in the right path. During these travels he met at Venice
Lenbach, the portrait-painter, who told him to study in Munich.
Tired of wandering he acted upon the suggestion, and passed six
years in the Bavarian capital. For a period his art assumed a religious
character, and he painted many biblical compositions. These works
were coldly received, and in Munich they were strongly and
adversely criticised. The clergy objected to them as profane, and a
debate on the subject followed in the Bavarian Assembly. The life
of the artist becoming exceedingly uncomfortable, Liebermann
settled in Amsterdam, where he found a freer artistic atmosphere more
congenial to his temperament. Disdaining the critical capacity of his
native city, Liebermann forwarded all his finest works to Paris, and in
the Salon of 1881 exhibited <i>An Asylum for Old Men</i>, which gained a
medal in the third class, the first honour awarded to German art
since the war. Having received the official imprimatur of Paris, his
countrymen began to realise that an artist had grown up amongst
them they could no longer afford to neglect. Liebermann’s works
found purchasers throughout the Continent, and his future was
assured. He was elected a member of the “Cercle des Quinze,”
of which Alfred Stevens and Bastien-Lepage were prominent supporters,
and he exhibited annually at the Salon Petit and other French
collections. Since 1884 he has divided his time between Berlin and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>the little village of Zandvoort, near Hilversum, in Holland. Perhaps
his early experiences account for the fact that when in the German
capital he mixes little with its artistic society.</p>

<p class='c021'>Liebermann has practised with success and ability every variety
of artistic expression. His portraits alone would class him amongst
the masters, taking as examples the <i>Burgomeister Petersen</i>, the <i>Professor
Virchow</i>, and the <i>Gerhart Hauptmann</i>. He is equally facile with the
burin, the needle, the pastel, or with water-colours. His activity is
ceaseless, and his production, in consequence, enormous; he possesses
robust health, uncommon strength, enormous fertility, traits common
to the great artists of all ages.</p>

<p class='c021'>In his fine canvas of the <i>Courtyard of the Orphanage, Amsterdam</i>,
painted in 1881, Liebermann shows for the first time complete
emancipation from the thrall of Munkacsy’s influence. The picture
was exhibited in the Salon of 1882, and in it appears that peculiar
note of red, now one of the distinguishing features of the artist’s
work. Of this canvas Hochédé, the Parisian art critic, said that
Liebermann must surely have been stealing sunbeams to paint with.
Then commenced a long series of pictures such as the <i>Ropeyard</i>, the
<i>Netmenders</i>, now one of the most valued pictures in the modern
section of the Gallery at Hamburg, in which the Impressionist spirit
is clearly manifested. The unimportant has been omitted, and the
pith of the subject only is given. The point of view is focused, the
inconsequent suppressed, and the “mise en scène” proves the artist
to be an irreproachable draughtsman, as well as a colourist of the
first rank. Liebermann’s pictures of “sous bois” are particularly
pleasing, strikingly painted and original; they were the first of
their kind in Germany, and disconcerted the whole artistic community.</p>

<p class='c021'>In following the progress of Liebermann’s art, one notes that he
is attracted unceasingly by problems of light. If Manet is the great
apostle of “plein air” painting, surely no one has yet surpassed the
marvellous style in which Liebermann succeeds in rendering the
attenuated scheme of interior lighting in conjunction with extraordinary
powers of sunlight painting. His gradual emancipation
from tradition may be easily traced from the days of <i>Women plucking
Geese</i>, when he was with justice called a “son of darkness”; through
the “sous bois” pictures, to the present period of vivid sunlight
and violet shadows across open country, sea, and the human
figure.</p>

<p class='c021'>Liebermann headed the party which revolted from the National
Salon, and of the Secessionists he is the president. Similar cleavages
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>of the young and progressive from the old and reactionary have taken
place in most countries with equally important results. In Max
Liebermann Germany has an artist of most exceptional gifts. “I do
not seek for what is called the pictorial,” he writes, “but I would
grasp nature in her simplicity and grandeur—the simplest thing and
the hardest.”</p>

IT is the fashion nowadays amongst a certain class of
art-critics to adopt the pessimistic note. They laud
the past, deplore the present, and display sympathetic
alarm for the future of art and artists. Should a
modern manifestation of art be under discussion, some
phase undeniably good and universally accepted by
those best qualified to form an opinion, these critics
recognise it with a guarded qualification and a prophecy of its
speedy decadence in the immediate future; and these depreciatory
remarks are extended to all those artists who have been attracted by
the new movement and have ranged themselves under its banner.
It has always been so. In the art literature of the past we read of
Delacroix and the decadence, of Corot and the downfall, of Monet
and the abyss. There are still living in France aged and honoured
professors, members of the Institute and of the Salon juries, who
believe that the teaching of Claude Monet has been a national
calamity. They hold that art no longer exists, having been
destroyed by these dreadful innovations. Is it not strange that the
birth of new methods, rather than the death of old ones, should be
heralded with melancholy head-shakings, with frequent and wrathful
imprecations upon the impious intruders! Time rights all things.
The new to-day is old to-morrow, the exotic becomes classic, and
one more page is added to the history of the evolution of art.</p>

<p class='c021'>Nothing is more amazing than to read in the daily and weekly
press of the “pernicious influence” and decadence of modern French
art, criticisms the more astonishing as the present age is one of
universal travel and liberal ideas. French art is in no such parlous
state, and never, at any period of its history, displayed stronger signs
of vitality. Never was its activity greater, nor its influence, poetry,
and gaiety better for the general good of the nation. Such wild
accusations are unjustifiable, hypocritical, and themselves pernicious.
French influence dominates the work of the most successful painters
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>and sculptors throughout the world. The art of such men as La
Thangue, Edward Stott, Alfred East, Peppercorn, Bertram Priestman,
Arnesby Brown, Fred Footet, John Lavery, Macaulay Stevenson,
Edwin Abbey, John S. Sargent, George Clausen, and the men of the
Glasgow school, is unquestionably derived from Paris, a city we are
asked to believe is decadent in art matters. Of these artists it may
be said that the majority were educated in Paris. It is well to
acknowledge candidly that, although in the days of Gainsborough,
Turner, Constable, and the other members of that brilliant band,
English art led the world, to-day we must look to “la ville
lumière” for instruction and inspiration. The fact is proved by the
enormous preponderance of students of all nationalities who flock to
Paris for the completion of their art education. In other words,
French art is the leading art of the day, and will remain so for
many years to come.</p>

<p class='c021'>Let any unbiased observer compare the two magnificent Salons
of Painting and Sculpture held annually in Paris with the English
Royal Academy, New Gallery, and British Artists’ Exhibitions.
Note that France houses her artists in some of the most beautiful
palaces in the world, then think of London. Observe the high
average quality of the exhibits, their astounding technical excellence,
the courage of the artists, and their bold experiments in untrodden
paths, their extraordinary originality and diversity of temperament.
They are not content with an ephemeral success, or the stereotyped
reproduction of popular playthings. The contributors are cosmopolitan
in nationality, for, provided the necessary passport of
talent, Paris welcomes the stranger. Where in Great Britain can
the foreigner, even if he possess acknowledged genius, be sure of
meeting with a sympathetic reception and fair play from a Hanging
Committee? He is fortunate if he escapes public ridicule. The
Continental artist has learnt this lesson and troubles us no more, to
the blight of our national education and the detriment of our taste.
This blot upon our reputation for common sense has been to some
extent redeemed of recent years by the International Society of
Painters, Sculptors, and Gravers. Perhaps its intermittent exhibitions
will rehabilitate our name abroad, and incidentally aid in revivifying
our national taste.</p>

<p class='c021'>Recall haphazard the names of a few artists who are at the
present moment exhibiting in France. Aman-Jean, Barillot, Binet,
Besnard, Billotte, Bracquemond, Cottet, Chèret, Carrière, Cassatt,
Cazin, Dagnan-Bouveret, Daillon, Dameron, Didier-Pouget, Degas,
d’Espagnat, Forain, Fantin-Latour, Geffroy, Gosselin, Gaston la
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>Touche, Gagliardini, Guillaumin, Harpignies, Henner, Lhermitte,
Le Sidaner, Meunier, Marais, Monet, Menard, Maufra, Montenard,
Pointelin, Ribot, Rigolot, Raffaëlli, Rodin, Renoir, Roybet, Ziem.
This list can be extended indefinitely by the addition of the names
of artists of the rarest temperaments. The art of the whole of the
rest of the world cannot surpass the productions of these men.</p>

<p class='c021'>The state of the plastic arts in England is deplorable. If it be
not soon remedied, we shall be compelled to go abroad for any statues
needed. The little sculpture we have is frequently excellent, but its
output is so insignificant that it cannot possibly be compared with
the sculpture of France. The art cannot flourish in England whilst
there are so few public commissions, or wealthy patrons. Financially
the painter’s career is bad enough, but, as a remunerative profession,
sculpture does not exist. Look around the galleries in London
during the height of the season, and note the quite insignificant
amount of sculpture exhibited. Many of the London galleries
exclude it altogether, and in the provincial collections it is
practically non-existent. If there is any it is systematically
overlooked by visitors, and as for sales—! one never hears of such a
thing. Then remember Paris with its immense annual production
of excellent sculpture, and the admirable manner in which the State
fosters this great art.</p>

<p class='c021'>If we take monuments and statues in public places as the fittest
expression of national gratitude, we are sadly lacking. Where in
England can we find monuments in perpetuation of the memory of
such mighty painters as Turner, Reynolds, Gainsborough, Constable,
Romney, and a score besides. If we possess such monuments, they
are certainly hidden away from the sight of both native and
stranger, and the latter frequently remarks upon their absence. In
France the birthplaces of these artists would have raised some
remembrance, whilst the capital city in which they laboured would
surely have had its statues and collegiate endowments to perpetuate
their spirit. An example can be quoted from the little country
town in which these lines are being written. Here in Les Andelys,
in the most prominent position, are two statues. One of them is as
fine a memorial as can be seen in any capital city of Europe. The
men so honoured in imperishable bronze are not kings, generals,
statesmen, or even local benefactors. They are merely artists, and
one of them (the son of an Englishwoman) is but distantly allied to
the countryside. Chaplin and Poussin, two artists of thoughtful,
gentle lives, of obscure birth, without fortune or influence, yet
possessors, in some degree, of the ennobling fire of genius. Of these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>men the simple townspeople are exceedingly proud, and in such
pride we see the whole spirit of the nation. France delights to
honour genius, and the intelligent foreigner, noting these things,
will pay little heed to stories that decadence and pernicious
influences are the outcome of such a feeling.</p>

<p class='c021'>Following the lead of Paris, American painters may be said to
have adopted “la peinture claire” almost to a man. Germany also
has revolted, and the Secessionist movement, with Liebermann at its
head, has gathered together the most vigorous talent in modern
German art. Clean painting in a pure and healthy atmosphere now
reigns supreme. Spain and Italy have also been deeply affected, and
in both of these countries there is a marked recrudescence of that
fine talent which in times past distinguished the two peninsulas.
Together with this increasing activity is happily to be noted a
commensurate degree of financial encouragement. Enormous sums
yearly change hands in Germany alone for the products of the new
school, irrespective of nationality. The sales recorded at the annual
exhibitions in Berlin, Munich, Dresden, and Dusseldorf average
about twenty times the amounts received at the Royal Academy,
and it is clear that Germany intends to take as leading a position in
the arts as she is doing in commerce.</p>

<p class='c021'>The tendency in England appears to be retrograde. Modern
Dutch art reigns as the present fashion, its propagation admirably
engineered, its influence widespread. The pictures <i>à-la-mode</i> are
those with foggy, sombre grey skies in heavy unatmospheric paint.
They give us damp discoloured tenements, shipping the colour of
coal-tar, clumsy barges, malodorous canals, ugly toil-broken humanity,
the whole as unromantic, depressing, and dyspeptic as can be
imagined. The seal of official approbation has been secured for this
kind of thing, and the Mansion House requisitioned for its display.
This poetry of the prosaic has been generally accepted, and never
have times been better for the sturdy, plodding producer of Dutch
pictures. As it is the dark and sordid side of Nature that appeals
most forcibly to these men, we shall, within a given time, develop a
whole race of “Nubians” of our own. Finally we shall deny the
very existence of the sun and all he represents in our limited share
of life.</p>

<p class='c021'>The cult of sun-worship, of joy in sparkling colour, of pure
health-bringing open-air art must, sooner or later, predominate in
England as it already predominates throughout the world. The
mission of Impressionism is to depict beauty that elevates, light that
cheers. In their struggle for this mastery of light, Impressionist
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>painters have often in the past sacrificed many of the qualities which
go towards the making of a picture, and have thus incurred public
displeasure. Their subjects have been chosen at random, and they
have gained their effects often regardless of composition. The
artists were far too much occupied by technical difficulties to care
about picture-making, and the results, mere studies, were not
intended as pictures. They were the necessary experiments
incidental to the invention of “Impressionism.” Yet how preferable
are these “studies” to the ordinary canvases of commerce, and how
treasured they are at the present day. Now that the material
difficulties have been overcome, and settled methods achieved, this
reproach will disappear, and we may confidently look to the
Impressionist picture for all those qualities which go to the making
of a perfect work of art.</p>

<p class='c021'>In the canvases of Vincent Van Gogh, Gauguin, Claus, Maufra,
d’Espagnat, Liebermann, Harrison, Besnard, Le Sidaner, and many
others of the later school, will be found not only colour, rich light,
and subtly strong harmonies, but a feeling for beauty of line,
composition, rhythm of movement. Our admiration for the great
men of 1870 must not blind us to the fact that there are others; the
road is not barred, and many of the followers are of great strength.
The pioneers having opened up the new territory, the gift is free
and all are welcome.</p>

  <h2 class='c011'>APPENDIX</h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c026'>(<i>a</i>) THE SCIENTIFIC ASPECT OF IMPRESSIONISM</h3>

<p class='c027'>The clearest explanation of the scientific theory of colouring is to be found
in the treatise written by Chevreul. First published in France in 1838, it
met with great success, and was translated into English in 1854 by Charles
Martel. Chevreul remains the standard authority, although he has been
followed by Helmholtz, Church, Rood, and others.</p>

<p class='c021'>Given the necessary competence for accuracy in draughtsmanship, and
considerable practice in the manipulation of colour, the art-student may take
the field, and not before; for Impressionist painting demands the highest
artistic capability. Firstly, he will discover that Impressionists worship light,
using the trees, rocks, rivers, &amp;c. of landscape, as so many vehicles for the
conveyance of luminous impressions to the eye. This quality of atmosphere
distinguishes Impressionist pictures from all others; here will be found
what Brownell, Chevreul, MacColl, and Mauclair, have to say upon the
subject. Secondly, the art-student will perceive the vital necessity of correct
values within a general tone, a subject also enlarged upon by the above
writers. Thirdly, some reference is given to the modern study of shadows
and reflections, with regard to their influence and treatment.</p>

<p class='c021'>The following lines, extracted from “The French Impressionists,” by
Camille Mauclair, sum up definitely the Impressionist Idea.</p>

<p class='c028'>“In nature no colour exists by itself. The colouring of the objects is a
pure illusion: the only creative source of colour is the sunlight which
envelops all things, and reveals them, according to the hours, with infinite
modifications.... Only artificially can we distinguish between outline and
colour; in nature the distinction does not exist.... A value is the degree
of dark or light intensity, which permits our eyes to comprehend that one
object is further or nearer than another.... The values are the only means
that remain for expressing depth on a flat surface. Colour is therefore the
procreatrix of design. Colour being simply the irradiation of light, it follows
that all colour is composed of the same elements as sunlight, namely the seven
tones of the spectrum.... The colours vary with the intensity of light.
There is no colour peculiar to any object, but only more or less rapid
vibration of light upon its surface. The speed depends, as is demonstrated by
optics, on the degree of the inclination of the rays which, according to their
vertical or oblique direction, give different light and colour.... What has
to be studied therefore in these objects, if one wishes to recall their colour to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>the beholder of a picture, is the composition of the atmosphere which
separates them from the eye. This atmosphere is the real subject of the
picture, and whatever is represented upon it only exists through its medium.
A second consequence of this analysis of light is, that shadow is not absence
of light, but light of <i>a different quality</i> and of different value. Shadow is not
a part of the landscape where light ceases, but where it is subordinate to a
light which appears to us more intense. In the shadow the rays of the
spectrum vibrate with different speed. The third conclusion resulting from
this: the colours in the shadow are modified by <i>refraction</i>.... The colours
mixed on the palette compose a dirty grey.... Here we touch on the very
foundations of Impressionism. The painter will have to paint with only the
seven colours of the spectrum, and discard all the others; that is what Claude
Monet has done boldly, adding to them only black and white. He will,
furthermore, instead of composing mixtures on his palette, place on his canvas
touches of none but the seven colours <i>juxtaposed</i>, and leave the individual rays
of each of these colours to blend at a certain distance, so as to act like sunlight
itself upon the eye of the beholder.”</p>

<p class='c030'>“Take a landscape with a cloudy sky, which means diffused light in the
old sense of the term, and observe the effect upon it of a sudden burst of
sunlight. What is the effect when considerable portions of the scene are
suddenly thrown into marked shadow, as well as others illuminated with
intense light? Is the absolute value of the parts in shadow lowered or raised?
Raised, of course, by reflected light. Formerly, to get the contrast between
sunlight and shadow in proper scales, the painter would have painted the
shadows darker than they were before the sun appeared. Relatively they are
darker, since their value, though heightened, is raised infinitely less than the
value of the parts in sunlight. Absolutely their value is raised considerably.
If therefore they are painted lighter than they were before the sun appeared,
they in themselves seem true. The part of Monet’s picture that is in shadow
is measurably true, far truer than it would have been if painted under the old
theory of correspondence, and had been unnaturally darkened to express the
relations of contrast between shadow and sunlight. Scale has been lost. What
has been gained? Simply truth of impressionistic effect. Why? Because
we know and judge and appreciate and feel the measure of truth with which
objects in shadow are represented; we are insensibly more familiar with them
in nature than with objects directly sun-illuminated, the value as well as the
definition of which are far vaguer to us on account of their blending and
infinite heightening by a luminosity absolutely overpowering. In a word,
in sunlit landscapes objects in shadow are what customarily and unconsciously
we see and note and know, and the illusion is greater if the relation between
them and the objects in sunlight, whose value habitually we do not note, be
neglected or falsified. Add to this source of illusion the success of Monet
in giving a juster value to the sunlit half of his picture than has ever been
systematically attempted before his time, and his astonishing ‘trompe d’œil’ is,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>I think, explained. Each part is truer than ever before, and unless one have
a specially developed sense of ‘ensemble’ in this very special matter of values
in and affected by sunlight, one gets from Monet an impression of actuality so
much greater than he has ever got before, that one may be pardoned for
feeling, and even for enthusiastically proclaiming, that in Monet realism finds
its apogee. Monet paints absolute values in a very wide range, plus sunlight,
as nearly as pigments can be got to represent it.”</p>

<p class='c030'>“Impressionism is the art that surveys the field and determines which of
the shapes and tones are of chief importance to the interested eye, enforces
these, and sacrifices the rest.</p>

<p class='c031'>“If three objects, A, B, and C, stand at different depths before the eye, we
can at will fix A, whereupon B and C must fall out of focus, or B, whereupon
A and C must be blurred, or C, sacrificing the clearness of A and B. All this
apparatus makes it impossible to see everything at once with equal clearness,
enables us, and forces us for the uses of real life, to frame and limit our
picture, according to the immediate interest of the eye, whatever it may be.</p>

<p class='c031'>“The painter instinctively uses these means to arrive at the emphasis and
neglect that his choice requires. If he is engaged on a face he will screw his
attention to a part and now relax it, distributing the attention over the whole
so as to restore the bigger relations of aspect.</p>

<p class='c031'>“Sir J. Reynolds describes this process as seeing the whole ‘with the
dilated eye;’ the commoner precept of the studios is, ‘to look with the eyes
half closed.’ In any case the result is the minor planes are swamped in
bigger, that smaller patches of colour are swept up into broader, that
markings are blurred.</p>

<p class='c031'>“The Impressionist painter does not allot so much detail to a face in a

<p class='c030'>“The discovery of these Impressionists consists in having thoroughly
understood the fact that strong light discolours tones, and that sunlight
reflected by the various objects in nature, tends from its very strength of light
to bring them all up to one uniform degree of luminosity, which dissolves the
seven prismatic rays in one single colourless lustre, which is the light....
Impressionism, in those works which represent it at its best, is a kind of
painting which tends towards phenomenism, towards the visibility and the
signification of things in space, and which wishes to grasp the synthesis of
things as seen in a momentary glimpse.... One has now the right to say,
without provoking an outcry, that it has been given to the people of the
present time to witness a magnificent and phenomenal artistic evolution by
this succession of canvases painted by Claude Monet during the past twenty
years.”</p>
<p class='c032'><span class='sc'>Geffroy.</span></p>
<p class='c030'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>“Two coloured surfaces in juxtaposition will exhibit the modification to
the eye viewing them simultaneously, the one relative to the height of tone of
their respective colours, the other relative to the physical composition of these
same colours.... We must not overlook the fact, that whenever we mix
pigments to represent primitive colours, we are not mixing the colours of the
solar spectrum, but mixing substances which painters and dyers employ as
Red, Yellow, and Blue colours.... All the primary colours gain in
brilliancy and purity by the proximity of Grey.... Grey in association with
sombre colours, such as Blue and Violet, and with broken tints of luminous
colours, produces harmonies of analogy which have not the vigour of those
with Black; if the colours do not combine well together, it has the advantage
of separating them from each other.... Distant bodies are rendered sensible
to the eye, only in proportion as they radiate, or reflect, or transmit the light
which acts upon the retina.”</p>
<p class='c032'><span class='sc'>Chevreul.</span></p>
<p class='c030'>“The object of landscape painting is the imitation of light in the regions
of the air and on the surface of the earth and of water.... One must seek
above all else in a picture for some manifestation of the artist’s spiritual state,
for a portion of his reverie.... In the career of an artist, one must have
conscience, self-confidence and perseverance. Thus armed the two things in
my eyes of the first importance are the severe study of drawing and of values.”</p>

<h3 class='c026'>(<i>b</i>) SALES AND PRICES</h3>

<p class='c025'>For future comparison it will be interesting to note some results reached
at recent sales of Impressionist paintings. Pictures which, in the early
seventies, were unsaleable for five pounds, now average from £500 to £800
apiece, with a tendency to go much higher. A sale at New York, in
December 1902, of seventeen pictures by members of the Impressionist and
Barbizon schools, produced nearly £40,000, an average of £2300 for each
canvas. The last great public sale by auction was “La Vente Chocquet” at
the Petit Galerie, Paris, July 1, 1899. A few days previous to the sale the
writer had a long conversation with Claude Monet at Giverny. Discussing
the coming event, which was already exciting much press comment, Monet
told how the late Père Chocquet, as he was affectionately called, a “chef du
bureau” in the Department of Finance, had been a tower of strength to the
early Impressionists. He encouraged them, foretold ultimate triumph,
invested every franc of his savings in the purchase of their works, at prices
ranging from £2 to £10. Late in life M. Chocquet inherited, quite
unexpectedly, a large fortune. The Impressionists anticipated much, and the
studios were jubilant. Long cherished plans were rediscussed; the Chocquet
legacy was to be the source of a golden stream. But a great disappointment
was to come. With the increase of M. Chocquet’s riches came the decrease
and final extinction of M. Chocquet’s taste. He never bought another
picture!</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>Throughout the three days’ sale, the gorgeous rooms of M. Georges
Petit were crowded, although many well-known and wealthy buyers were
absent owing to the lateness of the season. Amongst the distinguished
collectors and dealers, from all parts of Europe and America, were the Counts
de Camondo, Gallimard, de Castellane, the Marquis de Charnacé, the Barons
Oberkampff and de Saint-Joachim, and Messieurs Degas, Cheramy, de St.
Léon, de la Brunière, de Léclanché, Clerq, Muhlbacher, Ligneau, André
Sinet, Antonin Proust, Escudier, Natanson, de Laivargott, Bigot, Ferrier,
Marcel, Cognet, Durey, Zacharian, Moreau-Latour, Mittmann, Durand-Ruel,
Bernheim, Allard, Montagnac, Vollard, Boussod, Rosemberg, and Camemtron,
Monet’s <i>La Prairie</i> realised 6400 francs, <i>Les Meules</i> 9000 francs, <i>Falaise à
Varengeville</i> 9500 francs, and <i>La Seine à Argenteuil</i> was knocked down to
M. d’Hauterive for 11,500 francs. Renoir’s works fetched between ten and
twenty thousand francs. Manet’s <i>Portrait of Claude Monet in his Studio</i>, which
was sold after Manet’s death for 150 francs, changed hands at 10,000 francs.</p>

<p class='c013'>At the Vever sale in 1897, Monet’s <i>Le Pont d’Argenteuil</i> realised 21,500
francs.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
